call money pressure from large german banks one or two large west german banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits money dealers said as a result call money soared in active trading to around the lombard rate of five pct from pct yesterday as banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily billion marks in interest free minimum reserve assets at the central bank over the first days of the month though this was above the march requirement of billion actual holdings at the weekend were billion to meet the daily average dealers said banks must raise holdings by two billion marks to billion today and tomorrow but liquidity was tight in early business because banks excessively took up the bundesbank s offer for sale of treasury bills on friday this provides a rate of pct for three day deposits and is an effective floor to the market though some liquidity from bills bought on thursday flowed back into the market today the bulk would not return until tomorrow the start of the new month dealers said dealers said the large banks which they did not name commanded short term money requirements of as much as five billion marks or so with a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills draining liquidity for three days when other banks sought funds rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return one senior dealer said the bundesbank with advanced knowledge of the market s needs should have curtailed its sales of treasury bills on friday though dealers only late in the day learn of the total minimum reserve holdings of the previous day the bundesbank has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate the strength of demand for funds the following day he said bundesbank dealers could easily have said we are not selling any treasury bills or we re not selling them in this amount he said if the bundesbank wants to finely steer the market then they should avoid such excesses tomorrow it will be different call money will fall back to pct or so but the bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in rates given the delicate state of currency markets international central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies including the mark dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer undertone contributing to downward pressure on the dollar the whole tender policy is to have a call money of between three and four pct in that case the excesses as we have today cannot be very popular the senior dealer said dealers said the large banks probably achieved average rates of return on their excess funds of between pct or four pct this is a higher return than they would have earned without the excessive draining through the treasury bill mechanism because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations between germany s major employers and the unions the bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy at its council meeting on thursday they said bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the lombard emergency funding facility to draw down billion marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business reuter

u s fed explores commodity basket index the complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices the newest member of the federal reserve board says commodity prices are already considered by the fed in the making of monetary policy but they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by governor robert heller who joined the board last august he conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed but argues that such an arrangement particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries could reduce the volatility of exchange rates moreover it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves slowing changes in inflation his idea which many conservative economists find appealing has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by president reagan it would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation key indicators such as unemployment and the rise or fall of the money supply changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly discussed on and off for a long time the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base what is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes says heller in the past this anchor was gold but the united states went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies a return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the soviet union and south africa the so called fixed rate system scuttled in the early s is still considered unworkable in the present world but the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely adding vast pressures to the monetary system is also being widely questioned some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also for one thing there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy moreover some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement the poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that not surprisingly helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems treasury secretary james baker the reagan administration s chief economic architect has preferred to use the so called group of five industrial countries or sometimes seven as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters he appears convinced that officials from west germany france britain japan italy and canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing the heller approach while extremely complex could have a profound impact on the system ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates as envisioned by heller a basket of say major commodities ranging from wheat to oil would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis in times of rising commodity prices monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices montary policy might be eased he says he notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis moreover most commodity prices are produced consumed and traded on a world wide basis so that an index has a relevance for the entire world he says in addition commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions he says however he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the s because of action by the opec cartel would have to be discounted in such a system he says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities reuter

ec agrees on need to strengthen ems european community ec finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the european monetary system ems against international market turbulence officials said there was a general will to reinforce the european monetary system with all that implies belgian finance minister mark eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one day session of informal talks at this belgian coastal resort the gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of ems parities within nine months in january the system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant ems currency the west german mark sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system but eyskens said february s agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the ec to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the ems he told a news conference yesterday s meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among ems member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries they also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable both when they reached their fixed ems limits and within their agreed margins but eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in luxembourg in june on the basis of proposals from the ec s monetary committee and committee of central bank governors he said the ec needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates the belgian minister whose country presently holds the presidency of the community made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the ems towards the ec s long term goal of economic and monetary integration we have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system eyskens said eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the ems has to be reinforced if the ec s plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by are to go ahead ec executive commission president jacques delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in october that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to dedramatise realignments of ems parities by letting high ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers however west german sources said bonn finance minister gerhard stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves he said several ems member countries believed the ems would work better if central banks held each other s currencies an issue of particular importance regarding west germany since the bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves he said the debate on dedramatising ems realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the january reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory the realignment was marked by acrimony between france and west germany with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul reuter
