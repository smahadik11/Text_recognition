Text classification using hyperdimensional computing
Hyperdimensional computing is considered to be an alternative for computation with numbers.
Hypervectors are high- dimensional, holographic, and (pseudo). 
These properties provide an opportunity for efficient computing.
Text classification is taken as an application of hyperdimensional computing.
An algorithm for classifying news articles from a stream of input letters is given as example.
It is found that using pentagrams of letters, the algorithm achieves a classification accuracy above 94% on eight news topics
