respects to a barge as any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out of line and you can turn a barge over an ordinary ship is compartmentalised and you have more stability he said cooper said cross channel ferries were normally perfectly stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level if you do get water into that area then you can get very severe effects on the stability of
