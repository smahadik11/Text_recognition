brazil anti inflation plan limps to anniversary inflation plan initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the economy is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring prices widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis announced last february the plan froze prices fixed the value of the new cruzado currency and ended widespread indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country s pct inflation rate but within a year the plan has all but collapsed the situation now is worse than it was although there was inflation at least the economy worked a leading bank economist said the crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account in and brazil s annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to cover the billion dlrs needed to service its billion dlr foreign debt for the first nine months of all seemed to be on target for a repeat with monthly surpluses averaging one billion dlrs but as exports were diverted and imports increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus plunged to mln dlrs in october and since then has averaged under mln japan february interim trade surplus jumps japan s customs cleared trade surplus in the first days of february jumped to billion dlrs from billion a year earlier the finance ministry said the february interim surplus was sharply up from a mln dlr surplus in the same january period fob exports rose pct from a year earlier in the first days of february to billion while cif imports fell pct to billion the average dollar yen rates were for exports and for imports against for exports and for imports a year earlier sweden to go ahead with s african trade sanctions sweden s ruling social democratic party gave full power to the government to decree unilateral trade sanctions against south africa prime minister ingvar calrsson said carlsson told a news conference the party decided the fight against apartheid took priority over sweden s traditional policy of only adopting sanctions with the backing of the u n security council the government will decide later what form the trade boycott will take and when it will come into force japan u s set to begin high level trade talks japan and the u s kick off top level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other the talks held annually at sub cabinet level to review the whole gamut of u s japan economic relations will pave the way for american secretary of state george schultz s one day stop over here at end week on his way home from china faced with growing congressional protectionist pressure the u s administration is pressing japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus u s officials said we appreciate their frustration a senior japanese government official said but we are also frustrated the official said the pct rise of the yen over the last months has hit japan hard forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad that has not yet shown up in dollar based statistics on trade but it will he said he said the u s administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with congress it would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments a senior u s official replied the talks begin tomorrow with high level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance which last year amounted to billion dlrs in japan s favour on the following two days the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt to such bilateral trade problems as super computers the structural talks are intended to be free wheeling discussions among senior officials tomorrow s topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing and the implications of government budget deficits these talks come at a particularly delicate time for the japanese government which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more some u s officials complained japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports as washington wants japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge u s budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance that budget deficit has meant that the u s is buying more imports japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices it condemns japan without due process one japanese official said that reference spoils what is otherwise a well thought out bill introduced by democratic senator lloyd bentsen he said japan is also not totally happy with the administration s trade bill particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the u s officials said nevertheless japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them we have no leverage one official admitted as a result tokyo is striving to meet u s complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields including super computers the u s is pressing for greater access to the japanese super computer market the japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers officials said taiwan plans new tariff cuts taiwan plans another round of deep tariff cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the u s a senior economic planner said wang chao ming vice chairman of the council for economic planning and development told reuters taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on products sometime in the second half of this year cuts of up to pct on those items were made last year and wang said further cuts would go much deeper we have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially he said the united states taiwan s main trading partner has said the island s import tariffs still ranging from a high of almost pct were unacceptable it has criticised the cuts as too selective taiwan s trade surplus with the united states hit billion dlrs last year the surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to billion dlrs which wang said made taiwan a target for u s protectionism wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened taiwan s position in talks with washington over export quotas particularly for shoes textiles and machine tools which are among the island s main export earners a special taiwanese trade delegation leaves for washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of taiwan textiles under the accord taiwan s textile export growth was limited to pct each year until taipei has said it is losing markets to south korea and hong kong which were given more generous terms talks show new canadian confidence group says canada s decision to raise the issue of a free trade pact with the u s was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of canadian self confidence a public policy study group said it suggests the canada of the immediate post war period when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world the washington based atlantic council said u s and canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries the world s biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments of about billion dlrs annually the council s study said the trade talks with a deadline of october for an agreement are the biggest issue in u s canadian relations the study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties the council said in the past most canadians have shied away from the notion of a free trade arrangement fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country times their size in population but at the same time it added canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world the council said that in the talks canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of u s duties against allegedly subsidized exports a recent example was the per cent duty the u s imposed on canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized the council said the chief u s concerns included ending curbs against u s banking insurance telecommunications and the so called cultural industries publishing broadcasting and films it said other major u s canadian issues were defense cooperation acid rain and the u s rejection of a canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the northwest passage japan moves to tighten chip export curbs the ministry of international trade and industry miti acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the u s to preserve a u s japan pact on semiconductor trade but major japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness a miti spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters trading houses applying for a miti export licence will be required to show such a certificate but those without it will not automatically be denied licences he said but some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak u s government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the july agreement japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey market sales by third party brokers who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for japanese makers under the agreement the miti spokesman said if the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means in that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure miti earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by pct in first quarter spokesmen for the firms said but they doubt the usefulness of the latest move as long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money a hitachi ltd hit t spokesman said swiss capital exports rise in january swiss capital exports rose to

china called on the united states to remove curbs on its exports to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology but the u s embassy replied that chinese figures showing years of trade deficits with the u s out of the last are inaccurate and said peking itself would have to persuade congress to change laws which limit its exports the official international business newspaper today published china s demands in a editorial to coincide with the visit of u s secretary of state george shultz it is extremely important that the u s market reduce its restrictions on chinese imports provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand chinese exports the editorial said the u s should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for chinese goods and admit china into the generalised system of preference gsp despite easing of curbs on u s technology exports in recent years control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries it added the paper also printed an article by china s commercial counsellor in its washington embassy chen shibiao who said that all kinds of difficulties and restrictions were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential he named them as u s protectionist behaviour curbs on technology transfer and out of date trade legislation the paper also printed a table showing that since bilateral trade began in china has had a deficit every year except and it shows the and deficits at billion and billion dlrs a u s embassy official said the u s did not accept peking s trade figures at all mainly because they exclude goods shipped to hong kong and then trans shipped to u s while u s figures are based on country of origin he said that if china wants to obtain gsp status it will have to lobby congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent peking getting such status the u s trade act of says that to qualify for gsp china must be a member of the general agreement of tariffs and trade gatt for which it applied in july and not be dominated or controlled by international communism the official said china was well aware of the laws some of which date to the anti communist early s but that there is not sufficient political will in the u s to change them china has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti dumping in the u s within the last two years which the u s side won he said but for the first time china signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods which may lead the u s side to withdraw the anti dumping case he added another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in peking s application to gatt china has the potential to disrupt world markets especially in textiles other gatt countries will be nervous about china in this respect but there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in gatt the diplomat said poland czechoslovakia hungary and romania are members of gatt but none has china s massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports in a speech today in the northeast city of dalian u s secretary of state george shultz said his country welcomed china s interest in participating in gatt the process of chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight the gatt rules were not designed for a large economy of the chinese type shultz said china can play an important role by actively joining gatt discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide china can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its gatt participation he said the problems facing u s china trade and gatt membership are similar a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs especially for exports and a de facto dual currency system in a memorandum backing its application presented to gatt last month china said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with guidance planning and economic levers the diplomat said that to join gatt china had much to do u s asks japan end agriculture import controls the u s wants japan to eliminate import controls on agricultural products within three years visiting u s under secretary of state for economic affairs allen wallis told eishiro saito chairman of the federation of economic organisations keidanren a spokesman for keidanren said the spokesman quoted wallis as saying drastic measures would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by congress wallis who is attending a sub cabinet level bilateral trade meeting made the remark yesterday in talks with saito wallis was quoted as saying the reagan administration wants japanese cooperation so the white house can ensure any u s trade bill is a moderate one rather than containing retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country he was also quoted as saying the u s would be pleased were japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three the spokesman said japan currently restricts imports of agricultural products a ban on rice imports triggered recent u s complaints about japan s agricultural policy china calls for better trade deal with u s china called on the united states to remove curbs on its exports to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of

protectionist behaviour curbs on technology transfer and out of date trade legislation belgian says ec would react to textile bill belgian foreign trade minister herman de croo said if congress passed legislation curbing world textile imports the only way the european community ec could react was to retaliate de croo said at a news conference if you limit textile imports you will re orient textiles to europe and that he said would trigger ec taxes on u s goods congress passed a textile bill two years ago but it was vetoed by president reagan on grounds that curbing imports to protect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliation u s trading partners a similar bill has been introducted this year in a congress with a bigger democratic majority and with a president weakened by the iran scandal de croo here for talks with administration officials and congressmen said if a textile bill passed the only way we could react would be retaliation and it would cause more retaliation which is not a good way to deal with problems he said if a textile bill was enacted we will impose taxes on a lot of american products he said it would be stupid we have to avoid that he said congressmen seem upset mosty with japan because of its massive trade suprlus with the united states and not with ec nations but ec nations will be hurt by the diverted shipments of asian textiles de croo also criticized the way u s officials try to solve ec trade issues saying each time we come in contact it a conflict contact the clouts are coming fom the west he said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross the atlantic and dramatized with headlines this is not the way to work in a serious way between two big powers de croo said rostenkowski says he will oppose protectionist trade bill in u s house rostenkowski opposes protectionist trade bill house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski said congress must avoid a temptation to pass a protectionist trade bill this year in remarks prepared for delivery before the national press club rostenkowski d ill predicted major trade legislation will be sent to president reagan by the end of this year but he warned that his conciliatory message on the trade bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn other countries their access to the american market would be curtailed unless they opened their markets to u s goods complaints about foreign trade restraints are not a smoke screen for protectionism they a plea for fairness rostenkowski said it is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the american market he added however he said there would likely be changes in the market access proposal from the plan which cleared the house last year that plan would have set a specific time table for foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face a pct cut in exports to the united states u k exports body gets new executive director export credits guarantee department has named malcolm stephens director of export finance at barclay s bank plc and a former career civil servant at ecgd for years to the post of executive director a department spokesman said stephens replaces jack gill who is retiring early aged a drop in the ecgd s business volume and a rise in its debt to the exchequer have led to criticism in parliament in recent years stephens said the fall in business volume was a top convern adding that the department may have to compete more aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar services the department s annual report for the year ended march showed exports insured by the department fell to billion stg from billion the year before while its debt to the exchequer almost doubled to mln stg stephens said he had no specific list of changes but among his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports the agency will have to review its policies on insuring export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis he said large lump political risk insurance is the sort of thing we want to take a look at you have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing stephens said in response to a qustion about whether ecgd will strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance recipients he noted that certain countries have already been removed from the list rostenkowski reluctant to back tax hike house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back the tax increase if it did not have president reagan s support he told a national press club luncheon there would be a number of tax proposals that could be debated if reagan sought a tax increase to help balance the budget however he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates enacted in last year s tax reform bill unchanged there have been calls in congress to hold the rates at the level rather than allow them to fall next year reagan proposed billion dlrs in revenue as part of his budget proposal but it did not include general tax increases on trade issues rostenkowski said he did not expect the major trade bill this year would single out any u s industry for special protection to go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide he said this apparently ruled out congressional approval of another textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports as was proposed again this year u s wine exports rose per cent last year exports of american wine rose per cent last year to a total of million gallons the wine institute said the san francisco based promotional group said per cent of the exported wine was from california and the top three markets were canada japan and britain japan which edged out britain as the leading importer of american wines in continued in second place canadian imports rose per cent to million gallons japan per cent to million gallons and britain per cent to gallons a spokesman for the institute said the declining value of the dollar and strong promotional efforts on the part of the california wine industry contributed significantly to the increased shipments the wine exports were valued at mln dlrs up from mln dlrs the previous year u s senate panel could consider trade measure the u s senate agriculture committee may take up a bill tomorrow that would strengthen the activities of u s agricultural trade teams in selected developing countries committee staff said the measure sponsored by committee chairman patrick leahy d vt and sen john melcher d mont would establish trade teams of between six and nine persons drawn from federal agencies and private voluntary organizations staff said the trade missions would seek to generate interest in the u s government s food donation and commercial programs pl section export credit and export enhancement and upon return be required to advocate extension of concessional or commercial benefits to interested countries the trade teams would be made up of representatives of the u s agriculture department state department the agency for international development and private voluntary organizations such as u s wheat associates the bill would require teams within six months to visit seven countries mexico philippines indonesia india bangladesh senegal and nigeria within one year after passage of the measure another eight countries would have to be visited peru kenya the dominican republic costa rica malaysia venezuela tunisia and morocco other countries could be added to the list senate staff members said the bill still in the drafting stages had broad support and was expected to be approved by the committee tomorrow spain to launch export drive spain unveils a billion peseta plan this month aimed at boosting exports to reach european community levels director general of the infe export institute apolonio ruiz ligero said the target is to raise exports to pct of gross domestic product over the next four years compared to pct now he said this is the minimum prevailing level in the ec and there is no reason why we should lag behind countries like italy which have a similar productive structure he said the plan calls for providing soft loans tax cuts and other fiscal benefits to exporters and raising spain s presence in international trade fairs consumer goods such as fashion and wine as well as traditional industrial exports will be promoted ruiz ligero said infe would double its annual budget to billion pesetas to finance the four year plan while the government s development aid fund fad would provide a special billion peseta grant the plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in real terms this year after a pct decline last year ruiz ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand which rose six pct last year after pct in he added that pct of spain s exports went to organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd countries the ec accounts for pct of the market and exports to the community rose seven pct last year the government plans to concentrate efforts on western europe and the u s the problem is convincing businessmen that exports are vital to survival in the context of ec competition he said he said spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand while turning their backs on foreign markets they have to realise their share of the home market is going to shrink with growing deregulation he said foreign companies are taking up positions in the domestic economy and it is it vital to secure a market share abroad baldrige concerned about korean taiwan deficits secretary of commerce malcolm baldrige expressed concern about the continuing u s trade deficits with south korea and taiwan and said that without an adjustment in exchange rates there is little likelihood of improvement speaking to the president s export council an industry advisory group baldrige said the trade deficit issue was under discussion with those countries i feel that unless we see an exchange rate adjustment we probably won t be able to see much of a change in the large surplus that taiwan in particular has with us he said in a wide ranging discussion on u s trade matters baldrige also repeated u s concern about an attempted takeover by japan s fujitsu company of fairchild computer he said that the japanese were resisting allowing u s companies into the giant computer business while at the same time attempting to acquire control of a u s company that does major computer business in the u s market lastly baldrige said that the united states was hopeful that it could complete a free market agreement with canada by the autumn but said major issues including acid rain remained unresolved ec appoints new trade chief the european community commission today appointed its chief spokesman hugo paemen as its top official in charge of multilateral trade negotiations a commission spokesman said paemen a belgian official who had previously been chief aide to former external affairs commissioner etienne davignon has been in his post since january the spokesman said paemen will continue as chief spokesman until the retirement on may of paul luyten who is now in charge of ec departments handling negotiations in the world trade body gatt the oecd and other forums s korean trade surplus with u s seen falling south korea s record billion dlrs trade surplus with the u s is bound to diminish as the country switches purchases from japan in favor of u s companies trade minister woong bae rha said he rejected suggestions the korean won is undervalued and denied any plans for a drastic and sudden revaluation rha is heading a trade mission to u s cities last year south korea ran a billion dlr trade surplus including a record billion surplus with the u s and a billion dlr deficit with japan rha told reuters in an interview the current trade mission is looking for billion dlrs in purchases from u s companies about a quarter of which represents transferred purchases from japanese sources rha said the items being sought by the current mission are mainly chemicals machinery and parts he said south korea is the fourth largest importer of u s agricultural products the current mission is not involved in that area but there are plans to buy substantial amounts of cotton from the u s he noted his country is clearly not as open as the american market nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be considering south korea has a billion dlr foreign debt and spends six pct of its gross national product on defense gatt council defers decision on semiconductors the ruling gatt council deferred a decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a european community complaint against the u s japanese agreement on exports of computer semiconductors david woods spokesman of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt told a news briefing that the main parties would continue bilateral talks this was in the hope of resolving the row before the next council meeting on april the five year accord signed in july aims to protect the u s market from dumping of low price japanese microchips officially known as semiconductors the e c complained the accord breached gatt trade rules by allowing tokyo to monitor prices allowing it to set minimum prices for japanese chips sold in third countries the nation community also charged the agreement gave u s producers preferential access to the japanese market woods said many nations hong kong canada switzerland singapore sweden malaysia and nigeria had supported the ec complaint during the heated council debate japan s delegate minoru endo and u s ambassador michael samuels replied in the debate that the e c charges were unfounded but they were willing to continue bilateral talks gatt sets up dispute panel on canadian herring the ruling gatt council set up a formal dispute panel to examine a u s complaint that a canadian law prohibiting export of unprocessed herring and salmon was discriminatory david wood official spokesman of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt told a news briefing the decision was taken after bilateral consultations failed to resolve the row u s ambassador michael samuels charged during the council debate that canada was trying to preserve domestic jobs by insisting that herring and salmon be processed at home robert white canada s deputy chief of delegation replied the law was in line with gatt rules and was for conservations reasons but he agreed to setting up the dispute panel british aide criticizes u s protectionism a senior british official said that protectionist bills being considered by congress could trigger retaliation by the european community eec and threaten the global trading system paul channon secretary for trade and industry said if congress passed legislation to curb textile imports which would hit ec shipments as well as shipments from major asian textile producers the community would have to retaliate his comments echoed those made yesterday by belgian trade minister herman de croo who said if the bill passed the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on u s exports channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with reagan administration officials and members of congress de croo was also in washington for trade talks channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in congress since his visit here last year as congress and the administration tried to find ways to reduce the u s trade deficit which last year hit a record billion dlrs channon also called for greater ec u s cooperation to force japan to open its markets to foreign goods channon said japan s trade surplus is causing everyone problems its surplus with the united states last year was billion dlrs and with ec nations billion dlrs the more united pressure there could be the better he said channon also called for increased u s ec cooperation to avoid trade disputes he said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost grains sales when spain and portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to ec standards but if both sides drew back from the brink that time he said it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion channon added that there is increasing reesentment in europe over the u s tactic of negotiating under the pressure of unilaterally imposed deadlines he said other potential conflicts are already in sight alleged european government subsidies of airbus aircraft and taxes on fats and oils and the commuity and the united states must therefore learn to manage their relations better he said another bill to let the united states retaliate against a nation if that nation s market was not open to u s goods would bypass the trade pact gatt general agreeeement on tariffs and trade as an arbiter of trade practices he said foreign trade law should be judged by gatt and not by the united states adding if the trade law is to be interpreted by the united states and not by the gatt what is to happen to the rest of us yeutter plans trade trip to china this summer u s trade representative clayton yeutter said he plans a july trip to china to discuss trade issues including china s admission to the general agreements on tariffs and trade yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible china could be a member of gatt before the end of the year they are making major moves to becoming a full scale member of the world economy he told the house appropriations subcommittee which oversees his agency s budget depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of china s gatt membership yeutter said he could put the final touches on the u s part of the agreement during his trip the admission of china to gatt which is the multinational group of nations which negotiates international rules on trade would offer both potential export markets and potential competition for u s industries he said that has a lot of potential as well as risks for u s business yeutter said i think china will develop into a fine market for us he added yeutter concerned about u s export picture u s trade representative clayton yeutter said he expects imports to fall soon but he was concerned about the lack of improvement in u s exports given the dollar s decline in the last months i m convinced we re about to see an improvement on the import side i m more concerned about the export side he told a house appropriations subcommittee part of the blame goes on other countries which have not generated the economic growth to increase demand for u s goods and part to some u s companies which are not generating competitive exports he said house trade bill drafting postponed the house ways and means trade subcommittee postponed until next week its opening session to start drafting major changes to u s trade laws a committee aide said the subcommittee had not yet completed the preparatory work to start writing the legislation the aide said belgolux trade moves into surplus in the belgo luxembourg economic union bleu moved into a narrow trade surplus of billion francs in after a billion franc deficit in figures given by a spokesman for the national statistics institute show he said imports fell last year to billion francs from in while exports were also lower at billion francs against billion in december the bleu had an billion franc trade surplus after a billion franc surplus in november and a billion franc surplus in december u s tells japan to do more to cut trade surplus u s undersecretary of state for economic affairs allen wallis said he had urged japan to do much more to reduce its large trade surplus with the united states our central message to japan this week was that while we have made progress in some areas much needs to be done he told a press conference after three days of talks what we need is a resolution of trade issues we need visible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage more imports and we need greater domestic led growth forecasting sluggish economic growth in japan this year wallis urged tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduce its trade surplus which hit a record billion dlrs in he named several areas of particular concern to washington computer microchips supercomputers kansai airport agricultural products and car telephones he warned that the u s japan agreement governing trade in semiconductors was in jeopardy despite the pact japanese producers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets other than the united states while u s penetration of the japanese market has not increased he said economic spotlight polish sanctions poland says u s sanctions have cost its economy billion dlrs and has made clear it wants washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses some of them are too sophisticated to convert into financial terms one banking source said but western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate they say it is blurred by the poor performance of poland s economy and dismiss the billion dlr figure as illusory sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under achieving they did have a bad effect yes but they only contributed to largely internal economic problems one said the u s imposed the measures and withdrew most favoured nation mfn trading status from poland in in retaliation for suppression of the solidarity free trade union under martial law the estimated cost to the polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the institute of national economy an offshoot of the central planning commission according to one western envoy an expert on polish economic affairs it extrapolated information on growth trends in trade with the united states as well as increases in credits from western commercial and government lenders but the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely he said dismissing the estimate as a theoretical projection based on a high point which has no real scientific evaluation a foreign trade ministry official said polish exports to the u s in the late s averaged around mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed imports have suffered slumping from around mln dlrs to mln as credits ran out poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the west last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted billion official figures show acknowledging that sanctions have lost poland important u s markets including agricultural equipment textiles chemicals and some foodstuffs western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons poland is accusing the west of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons said one expert it s an illusion based on a misunderstanding of western economy there s a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it another said adding that poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the s which were no longer today s reality describing the billion dlr assessment as nebulous one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new mfn status will have little impact on poland which has a hard currency debt of billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry mfn doesn t really mean anything only that poland will not be treated worse than other countries it will be difficult to regain access to the u s market because different forces are in play now said one western envoy he said polish products were not competitive and their quality was too low trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the u s japan and europe would also hamper poland s efforts to regain entry deputy foreign trade minister janusz kaczurba recognised this fact recently kaczurba told the official pap news agency recently making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult and in certain cases impossible in a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about mln dlrs while poland is unlikely to seek compensation it says it has a moral right to assistance from the u s which it says imposed the sanctions illegally but a western economist said the argument that u s sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the polish economy won t cut any ice the americans will just reply that the poles acted immorally in crushing solidarity nevertheless polish national bank head wladyslaw baka in talks in washington last week with the international monetary fund imf and world bank made it clear that poland was looking for a lead from the united states he was quoted by pap as saying that poland would meet its financial obligations to the united states but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners he stressed that the u s had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of poland s partners interested in the settlement of polish debt putting it more sharply one senior banking official blamed washington for obstructing talks with the world bank imf and paris club of western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role as a major superpower the united states can influence international organisations he said citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which western nations were prepared to cooperate yeutter says u s budget deficit reduction key to trade deficit solution consensus builds for world agricultural reform top u s and european farm trade and government representatives called for a sweeping reform of world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply imbalance speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here demonstrated a growing u s european consensus on the need for an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and production it is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and harmony into the world agricultural trade if not the disruptions in markets may grow even more severe the walls of protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation become more harmful u s department of agriculture deputy administrator william bailey said bailey said his attendance at the two day meeting which ends tomorrow demonstrated the u s recognises the need to adjust its policies to the changing market environment the need for urgent reforms is justified by the imbalance and tensions of the world economy the secretary general of the organisation for economic cooperation and development jean claude paye said and the forum for such a reform is the general agreement on tariffs and trade he noted paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures to help farmers in unprofitable areas another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm prices allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand and instead help farmers through income support and adjustment aids proposed james howard executive vice president of cargill usa one of the world s largest cereal houses franz josef feiter agricultural adviser to west german chancellor helmut kohl agreed the european community must take greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices however differentiated policy treatment is required to take account of large disparities in the situation around the ec he said agriculture is an efficient sector of the european economy and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the community he said france yugoslavia commission to boost trade france and yugoslavia agreed to set up a joint economic commission as part of efforts to promote commercial links and industrial cooperation between the two countries the french finance ministry said the commission to be composed of businessmen was agreed during talks between foreign trade minister michel noir and yugoslavian minister without portfolio egon padovan a ministry statement said both sides had agreed on the need to boost trade links in keeping with an accord signed last year calling for a pct rise in commercial exchanges between the two countries over the next six years french trade with yugoslavia has grown little over the past two years baker says g pact just a start treasury secretary james baker said the agreement among industrial nations in paris last month is only a start in washington s drive to intensify economic cooperation among leading countries in a speech to the national newspaper association baker said the six steps beginning with the plaza agreement and culminating in the paris accord are only a start he added we see our role as a steward of a process in which we sit down with our industrial allies to find ways to promote more balanced international growth the paris agreements called trade surplus countries to strengthen their growth and on the u s to reduce its budget deficit under such circumstances the countries agreed their currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals baker also said he still sees ominous signs of pressure for protectionist trade legislation and this pressure for protectionism is coming from new areas of society but he also said he believed a coalition was forming that supported free trade treasury s baker forecasts reduction in japanese trade surplus this year baker sees lower japanese trade surplus u s treasury secretary james baker said the japanese trade surplus would begin to decline this year he told the national newspaper association you re going to see a reduction in the japanese trade surplus some of it this year but he said the reduction would be due principally to the exchange rate shifts since the plaza agreement and these shifts would take a long time to work their way through the system nicaragua romania paraguay lose trade rights president reagan formally ended preferential duty free trade treatment for exports from nicaragua romania and paraguay under the generalized system of preferences gsp he took the action after determining that the three countries are not taking steps to give their workers internationally recognized rights u s trade representative clayton yeutter had announced the intended action on january the united states conducts no trade with nicaragua and very little trade with romania and paraguay bangladesh trade deficit narrows in october the bangladesh trade deficit narrowed to billion taka in october from billion in september and billion in october the central bank said imports dropped to billion taka in october from billion in september and billion in october exports totalled billion taka in october as against billion in september and billion in october study says u s canada pact would spur economies a free trade pact between the united states and canada could spur the economies of both sides substantially according to a study released by the institute for international economics the study by paul wonnacott said a successful conclusion to the free trade talks now under way could raise canada s gross national product by more than five pct and expand u s export s by about seven pct he said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of government subsidies end curbs on trade in services and investments and pave the way for new global talks under the general agreement on tariffs and trade the united states and canada the world s two biggest trading partners with cross border shipments of about billion dlrs a year opened free trade talks last june they are aiming for a pact by next october wonnacott an economics professor at the univerity of maryland said an agreement should include elimination of tariffs between the two countries phased in over a five to year period equal access to federal government procurement in the two countries replacing current buy america and buy canada provisions with a buy north america provision fewer restrictions in trade in services chiefly finance and transportation a commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor domestic producers a commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem the two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to or pct without imposing coutervailing duties the limit on subsidies is now pct he proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for resolution at an early stage wonnacott said bilateral free trade would contribute to the efficiency of the north american economies and to their competitiveness in facing overseas producers he said it would it would open u s markets to canadian goods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass production benefits to the united states would be fewer than those to canada proportionately he said because of the already large u s gross national product wonnacott said also that a u s canada pact in such areas as export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commission could set an example for the current attempt by gatt to write new and more liberal global trading regulations koreans to buy billion dlrs in u s goods south korean foreign trade minister rah woon bae said his country s firms have agreed to buy billion dlrs worth of u s goods during his two week buying trip to the united states rah said most of the purchases represented shifts from japanese firms to u s firms as part of south korea s effort to reduce its seven billion dlr trade surplus with the united states south korea has a five billion dlr trade deficit with japan soviet economist sees few gains in u s trade there is little chance soviet exports to the united states will rise in but moscow s current trade reforms should result in more trade in manufactured goods in future a soviet economist said sergey frolov chief economist at amtorg trading corp an agent for soviet trade organisations and industries told a u s ussr business meeting the soviet union produces few items that western nations want but reforms including upgrading the quality of goods and allowing joint ventures with foreign firms will encourage modest export gains in future frolov said the soviet union exported mln dlrs worth of goods to the united states in and imported billion dlrs worth he gave no trade forecast for but he said that even if all obstacles were removed total trade between the two countries would remain between two and three billion dlrs a year the post detente embargoes have taught the ussr to limit its trading with the u s he said economic spotlight japan pushes its chipmakers japanese microchip makers are being strong armed into compliance with a u s japan pact on semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening japan s market to foreign chips industry analysts said but doubts remain over whether the ministry of international trade and industry miti which is pressuring the firms can successfully battle market forces and whether the u s industry is geared up to take advantage of any breathing space they said u s threats to scrap the agreement signed last september have pushed miti to try harder to get recalcitrant japanese chipmakers to abide by the pact the analysts said miti has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry to get things done said bache securities japan associate vice president peter wolffe last month miti told chipmakers to cut production for the january to march period by pct to help dry up inexpensive chips that have escaped from japan to grey markets not subject to the pact s price controls the ministry also asked electronics firms to provide distributors with certificates designating them as authorised exporters in an effort to close loopholes through which grey marketeers sneak chips out of japan market analysts said u s trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in jeopardy because of continued dumping in non american markets and little sign of increased foreign sales in japan but major japanese firms appear to have agreed to the production cuts several analysts said last week nec corp said it would cut production in line with miti s request nec has been the most aggressive in resisting miti s demands said david keller analyst at james capel and co once nec cuts production it means they all have still pressures remain to keep production high japanese firms need high output to cut unit prices for u s sales that the commerce department assigns them under the pact the best way to lower cost is to produce more said salomon brothers asia ltd analyst carole ryavec preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also spur higher production next quarter merrill lynch analyst matt aizawa said grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new restrictions some industry officials said it s like tax avoidance schemes said steve donovan head of mmi japan k k as soon as you close one route another opens miti s pressure has annoyed some makers who had earlier shrugged off miti guidance it s getting to be like communism said one but analysts said output cuts could help by making it easier to increase prices as planned on april and forcing firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss they re going to have to start running their businesses like businesses bache s wolffe said miti has also been conducting a highly public campaign urging chip users to buy foreign made chips but u s industry officials said response has been mixed at best there has been some change but it s not across the board said one u s spokesman the companies have a varying degree of urgency the ultimate impact of all these efforts by miti on the troubled u s industry remains in doubt analysts added pressure to cut production of kilobit dram dynamic random access memory chips could merely speed the transition to one megabit chips where japan now leads analysts said whether u s firms are able to stage a comeback in memory chips or interested in doing so also remains unclear they said analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new u s consortium which hopes to challenge japan by developing the most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing even in the thorny area of access much depends on u s commitment as well as on japanese openness some said the sia u s semiconductor industry association doesn t even have an office here a source close to the industry said you could question just how committed they are in addition some industry analysts question the effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third country chipmakers such as those in south korea south korea s gaining market share said one analyst they re the real winners from the agreement soviet

korea to keep trade surplus years south korean trade minister rha woong bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt he said in an interview with reuter that after a few years it was likely south korea would drop barriers to foreign goods and move toward a more balanced trade position he said the present trade surplus was vital

reduce his country s billion dlr surplus with the united states and also to cut its billion dlr shortfall with japan rha said it was also due to a shift in exchange rates between the u s dollar and the yen that made it cheaper to buy u s goods than japanese goods he said south korea heavily relied on foreign trade and he hoped the leaders of major trading nations could find a way to resolve the growing trend toward protectionist legislation rha said i hope the leaders can get together to find a solution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions but he added the leaders seem hesitant to make concessions because of domestic political reasons speaking of his own country he said we have made a lot of concessions already he cited regulations permitting foreign investment in industrial firms allowing increased foreign banking activity and cracking down on piracy of intellectual property by strengthening protection of copyrights and patents rha said south korea had also lowered many

s house panel takes first trade bill votes house trade lawmakers took their first votes on measures designed to toughen u s trade laws but held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on controversial plans to protect american industries meeting in closed session the house ways and means trade subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues in the bill whether they will force major foreign trading partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the united states the subcommittee is considering a toned down version of democratic sponsored trade legislation that aims to open foreign markets but which drops last year s effort to force president reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting specific trade penalties the legislation faces another hurdle in the full ways and means committee next week before the full house votes on it rep richard gephardt a missouri democrat who is seeking his party s presidential nomination said he may offer an amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of those countries with barriers to imports of u s goods this would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus with the united states by japan south korea taiwan west germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances my criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for getting the trade deficit down he told reporters the trade law changes are to become part of a major congressional and administration effort to turn around the record u s trade deficit of billion dlrs last year by opening up foreign markets and making u s products more competitive house speaker james wright a texas democrat said again today he expects the full house will approve the trade bill by may and that reagan will accept the final congressional bill i expect whatever is reported by the ways and means committee will pass we will have a good bill and an effective bill he told reporters the comprehensive trade bill will include work by other committees to ease export controls on high technology to aid u s workers displaced by foreign competition to stimulate research and development to remove foreign trade barriers and to improve education and worker training the lawmakers agreed that for the first time a u s industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the country s economic development they transferred to u s trade representative clayton yeutter the powers now held by reagan to decide whether to retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and whether an injured industry deserves import relief they agreed to make it easier for a company to get temporary relief from import competition but agreed the industry should provide a plan to become competitive the administration has not announced its support but yeutter said yesterday i am cautiously optimistic that the democratic led house will come up with an acceptable bill soviet minister says trade boost up to french soviet first deputy prime minister vsevolod murakhovsky said at the end of a brief visit here his country wanted to boost joint business with france but that a reduction of france s trade deficit with the soviet union depended on the french murakhovsky who is also chairman of the state agro industrial committee gosagroprom told a news conference he had discussed a variety of possible deals with french companies rhone poulenc pechiney and imec declining to put figures on possible contracts he said he had discussed plant protection and the processing of highly sulphuric gas with rhone poulenc packaging technology for agricultural products with pechiney and fruit and vegetable juice processing with imec an official for pechiney said an agreement of intent on packaging could be signed soon but could not give any other details the other two companies were not immediately available for comment asked whether he foresaw a reduction this year of france s trade shortfall at billion francs in the first months of against billion for the whole of murakhovsky told reuters it all depends on france at a meeting in paris last january french and soviet foreign trade ministers said they were committed to increased efforts to reduce the deficit estimates at the time showed a french mln franc surplus for december murakhovsky said the soviet union was prepared to talk with anybody with interesting proposals offering latest technology and assuring a mutual advantage he said the soviet union had many tasks ahead of it and would deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting he encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws guaranteeing the interests of foreign partners in joint ventures but he said no agreements had yet been finalised under the new joint venture laws he said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a result of a one billion dollar accord signed in moscow last month with french businessman jean baptiste doumeng he said doumeng s interagra company was preparing proposals for further examination by the soviet union doumeng last month said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of goods murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent and designed primarily to renew and increase the soviet union s food production capacity britain calls on japan to increase imports britain today called on japan to increase foreign imports or risk the rise of protectionism and the harm it would bring to it and other trading nations british trade and industry secretary paul channon said japan must heed a report issued by a japanese government advisory body in december calling for faster domestic demand to help cut its trade surplus and restructure its economy i recognise that the strong yen has brought problems to japan s domestic economy he told a group of japanese businessmen in london but these short term difficulties should not be allowed to deflect japan from the fundamental reforms necessary he said it is not just a domestic issue for japan if import propensity does not expand very soon there is a real risk from protectionist lobbies particularly in the u s with whom japan has so massive a surplus he said they may well succeed in securing action by governments which would be highly injurious to trading nations like japan and the u k channon said there had been substantial growth in the volume of trade between japan and britain amounting to billion sterling billion dlrs last year but he added regrettably too much of it was in one direction with the japanese selling us billion sterling billion dlrs more than we sold them taiwan further relaxes foreign goods import curbs taiwan said it would soon relax import controls on some foreign items including stationery and books in a further effort to allow trading partners especially the u s greater access to its markets taiwan announced the easing of import curbs on some farm and industrial products last month a council for economic planning and development spokesman told reuters he said the new move was intended to balance trade between taiwan and its trading partners the island s trade surplus reached a record billion u s dlrs last year up from billion in in january taiwan cut import tariffs on some foreign products and allowed imports of u s wine beer and cigarettes we hope the measures will help reduce our trade surplus this year especially with that of the u s the spokesman said

the united states but the longstanding issue of provincial ratification remains to be settled speaking to reporters after nearly five hours of meetings with the premiers mulroney said further discussions would be held in june and september to discuss the role of the provinces in approving any new trade deal but he maintained progress was being made in the sweeping talks with the unites states that got under nearly two years ago it appears reasonable progress is being made in the talks mulroney said alberta premier don getty agreed things are running pretty quickly now the talks launched by mulroney s progressive conservative government after concerns about protectionist sentiment in the u s are aimed reducing the remaining barriers between the world s largest trading partnership but the provinces are expected to play a major role in any new trading arrangement and some of the provincial leaders complained of a lack of progress on reaching a ratification formula it s my view that we should be thinking about these things right now along with the questions of the substance of the agreement commented ontario premier david peterson who has been highly critical of the talks in the past but newfoundland premier brian peckford said an agreement was more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be no need for a hard and fast formula peckford said it appears canada is prepared to make concessions to the united states on financial services in order to make inroads on other bargaining areas such as agriculture canadian published reports quoting government sources say the two countries are close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border tariffs and many non tariff barriers over the next to years a rough draft of the accord is expected to be presented to the premiers at the june meeting while the finished document is hoped to be presented to congress in october it s a very tight time frame ontario s peterson said last night but at this moment it is tough to say what will transpire taiwan to relax import curbs on more goods taiwan will relax import controls on more foreign goods a government spokesman said today the move was to allow greater access to taiwan markets by overseas trading partners especially the united states an official of the council for economic planning and development told reuters import curbs on about foreign goods including stationery and books would soon be relaxed he said taiwan announced it would ease curbs on some farming and industrial products last month the official said the moves

deterioration has yet been reversed key u s house trade subcommittee approves bill to toughen u s trade laws no clear evidence trade gap reversed volcker federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said current data does not give a clear sign that the deterioration in the u s trade balance has yet been reversed the data we have in hand do not provide clearcut evidence that the deterioration in the trade balance has yet been reversed volcker said in remarks prepared for delivery to a luncheon for community leaders here however volcker said there are encouraging signs particularly the rising volume of exports over the past year achieved despite relatively slow growth abroad volcker warned it is not sustainable from an economic perspective to pile up foreign debt while failing to make the investment needed to generate growth and earn the money to service the debt he said the process of restoring external balance to the u s economy requires dealing with the budget deficit he said needed

implementing the accord we are faithfully abiding by the agreement but of course there are some problems a spokesman for the international trade and industry ministry told reuters he said the high

major deal was emerging opening a debate on free trade in the house of commons mulroney said an accord would create thousands of jobs in canada and bring greater economic prosperity to both countries mulroney who offered few new details of the talks said that while the negotiations were risky and difficult a profile of a major trade deal is now emerging in a minute address mulroney made an often passionate defense of the initiative that he said would give poorer areas of the country a major economic boost because of our trading patterns over a period of decades we are in the process of building two canadas one that is rich and promising one that is under developed and under employed said mulroney what we want is to make sure newfoundlanders and british columbians and albertans and others that they get their chance they must be given the opportunity to trade their way to prosperity few detials have been released on the trade talks which were launched nearly two years ago between the two nations that are each others most important trading partners recent published reports in canada quoting senior trade sources said the countries were close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border trariffs and many non tariff barriers over the next to years it has been reported a key stumbling block in the talks is a canadian proposal to find a new way to settle trade disputes something that would give canada protection from washington s tough trade remedy laws but mulroney sharply critical of protectionist sentiment in the u s said canada was a fair trader and

michael jopling british minister of agriculture fisheries and food warned it would not be sensible to provoke another dispute between europe and the united states jopling said in remarks prepared for an evening speech but some things are clear and they apply on both sides of the atlantic we cannot continue to pile up stocks while world demand shrinks he said governments must not operate farm policies as if they were purely domestic affairs with no impact on others they also have to recognize that they cannot in the long run develop a healthy and stable farm sector on the basis of protectionism and excessive subisdies and above all europe and the united states have too many common interests to make it worthwhile to engage in trade wars and competitive export subsidies which end by benefitting no one he added it is crucial that the united states and the european community remain friends jopling who is a member of the ec agriculture committee was in indiana to visit several farms prior to talks with u s officials in washington later this week jopling also criticized a recent proposal still under consideration by the ec for a tax on vegetable and fish oils he said his government would oppose such a move because we do not think it is correct that a shortage of funds to support ec farmers should be alleviated by raising money at the consumer s expense ec warns u s

growing impatience within the community on trade relations with japan but diplomats said the community is keen to continue talking with tokyo to try and solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war s korea says japan complains to gatt on trade plan japan has complained to the secretariat of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt that south korea s five year plan to cut its trade deficit with japan breaks gatt rules trade ministry officials here said they said japan submitted a report earlier this month alleging south korea s plan to import less from japan and more from the u s and elsewhere was tantamount to creating non tariff trade barriers south korea unveiled the plan in november it said it hoped to narrow its trade deficit with japan to two billion dlrs by south korea s trade deficit with japan was a record billion dlrs in and rose to mln dlrs in the first two months of from mln in the same period the plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to import japanese goods and to exporters to sell more to japan the officials said they believed the japanese action one step short of filing a suit was designed to bring south korea to the negotiating table and stop the plan the seoul government wants tokyo to ease various import restrictions and simplify customs inspections for south korean goods to help reduce the trade deficit japan says u s japan microchip pact working japanese officials sought to convince the u s that a u s japan pact on microchip trade is working ahead of an april deadline set by the u s for them to prove their case we are implementing the agreement in good faith and the situation does not run counter to the pact osamu watanabe director of the ministry of international trade and industry s miti americas and oceanic division told foreign reporters the effects of the measures we have taken and are taking are emerging in the market place he said u s trade officials have repeatedly accused japanese microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at below cost in markets outside japan and the united states the agreement signed last september aimed at halting predatory japanese pricing policies and increasing u s semiconductor firms access to the japanese market the comments by miti officials followed a call by prime minsiter yasuhiro nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on the u s side about the pact watanabe said yukio honda director of miti s industrial electronics division denied that japanese chipmakers were selling at below cost in third countries miti s call to japanese chip makers last month to cut production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in the non regulated grey market honda said the grey market exports from japan are shrinking now but in contrast u s and south korean companies are expanding market share because of their cheaper prices honda said miti plans to take further steps to reduce the excess supply of inexpensive chips which developed in japan after the pact was formed because of a slump in japanese semiconductor exports to the united states he added the ministry will soon release its supply demand guidelines for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are likely to be lower than that for the first quarter he said despite businessmen s ingenuity in finding ways around any artificial controls regulation of supply and demand should bring positive results watanabe said i am optimistic he added ec warns u s

the general agreement on tariffs and trade that south korea s five year import diversification plan violated the spirit of the world trade governing body a foreign ministry spokesman said the notification came in japan s answer to a recent gatt questionnaire on unfair trade practices the spokesman said in the five year plan which starts this year south korea aims to reduce its dependency on japan as a source of imported goods and to increase imports from the u s and europe japan s move came after several unsuccessful bilateral negotiations on the plan the spokesman said the notification does not represent anything resembling a formal complaint nor is it intended to pressure south korea it is a routine procedure followed by all other gatt member states dutch official warns of more trade conflicts already strained relations between the u s and the european community ec are likely to get worse before they get better director general of the dutch economics ministry s foreign affairs division frans engering said speaking at an american chamber of commerce lunch in the hague engering noted the developing history of crises over steel citrus and pasta and warned of more to come i consider the strident tone of us declarations on airbus ill advised and the ec fats and oils tax proposal a dangerous provocation he said i feel that we shall probably have to deal with quite a few more crises in the foreseeable future not only is the us congress clearly very determined to get the american balance of payments into better shape but the risks of brinkmanship are all the greater because the ec has its own constraints in meeting outside pressure engering noted if we ask ourselves whether it is perhaps inevitable that we keep pushing each other to the brink of actual trade war then i think the answer is probably yes he said in order to reduce these tensions decision making in the ec must become less self centred and the us administration will have to exercise the authority to convince congress and pressure groups of the need for accommodation he added u s treasury announces oecd tied aid pact u s treasury secretary james baker said an agreement has been reached by members of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd to control the unfair trade practice of using tied aid to promote trade he said in a statement the agreement culminates the reagan administration s effot to negotiate a virtual end to export credit subsidies the practice of other governments using tied aid or mixed credits to promote exports has cost the united states lost jobs and lost exports the treasury said the agreement to be implemented in two stages by july would ban tied aid credit among industrialized countries and place limits on permitted aid by developing countries it would also reduce export credits that do not involve aid and reduce credit subsidies permitted for relatively poor countries the treasury said baker said the agreement imposes particular sacrifices on japan and praised japan s willingness to accept the pact as a demonstration of the japanese government s willingness to take concrete steps to resolve important trade issues oecd agrees export credit reforms the western industrialised nations have agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for exports to developing countries the organisation for economic cooperation and development said the reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to subsidise export credits in so called mixed credits the oecd said the agreement to be implemented in two stages in july this year and july means the minimum aid component in mixed credits will be raised to pct from pct and to pct for credits covering exports to the world s least developed nations additionally a new formula will be used for calculating the aid element in mixed credits to take account of different interest rates in the exporting countries the nation oecd which hosted the reform negotiations said minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the subsidies and ending them completely on loans to relatively rich developing countries by july next year the reforms follow several years of pressure by the u s to stop competitors notably france and japan using foreign aid to subsidise exports putting u s firms at a disadvantage oecd officials said the agreement was based on a provisional accord reached in january subject to ratification by member governments some governments including austria had linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which would be discussed at a meeting here in mid april they added by raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too costly for frequent use a major loophole in the general agreement on tariffs and trade has been closed today a senior u s official here commented rotterdam signs cooperation agreement with tokyo the city of rotterdam today signed an agreement in principle to cooperate with the aomi cargo distribution centre in tokyo acting mayor roel den dunnen said that cooperation between private and public entities in the tokyo and rotterdam area and a fruitful exchange of information have a favourable influence on the flow of goods and services between the two countries the aomi cargo distribution center which will start operating in october this year signed a similar agreement with rotterdam s twinned port of seattle last september ec warns congress on new trade bill the european community ec has warned the u s house of representatives that tough trade legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by u s trading partners the warning was sent in a letter from sir roy denman head of the ec delegation in washington to dan rostenkowski chairman of the house ways and means committee a copy of the letter was made available to reuters denman told rostenkowski an illinois democrat he backed aspects of the bill such as one backing new talks under the gatt and one excluding protection for the textile industry but denman disagreed with other provisions which would require president reagan to take retaliatory trade action against nations with large trade surpluses with the u s and would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade practices denman told rostenkowski that gatt regulations prohibit member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in trade disputes unless the action is gatt approved he said if the congress makes retaliatory action mandatory then the united states would be in violation of its international legal obligations and on a collision course with its major trading partners denman added that a president should have flexibility in enforcing trade laws saying in the last resort any administration must take its decision in light of the overall national interest otherwise he said the risk would be counter reaction by trading partners of the united states i e retaliation or enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against imports from the united states denman also said congress could prompt retaliation if it reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for firms to file unfair trade practice claims retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards for findings that imports were injuring u s firms changes in these standards must be agreed upon multilaterally they cannot be imposed by the united states alone on the world trading system he said house leaders have rejected a plan by textile state legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb imports of cloth and clothing similar to a measure passed two years ago but vetoed by president reagan there was concern by the leaders that reagan would veto the entire trade bill because of the textile amendment peru short term trade lines rise to mln dlrs peru s

foreign banks u s house panel votes to ease export controls a key house panel voted to greatly ease government controls on exports as several house committees moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws they hope will help solve u s trade woes the house foreign affairs subcommittee on international economic policy voted to direct the administration to cut the list of controlled exports by per cent by removing items no longer considered important to u s military security industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign competitors who were allowed to export freely products u s companies could not sell abroad the issue has been the subject of administration debate the commerce department had held that unnecessary restrictions impeded u s exports while the defense department said current controls should be retained but better administered four congressional panels met today to consider portions of a wideranging trade bill that intends to help u s companies sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade practices their separate proposals some of them conflicting will be woven by house democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a vote by the full house in late april sparked by the proposal of fujitsu ltd to take controlling interest in schlumberger ltd s fairchild semiconductor corp the house energy and commerce subcommittee on commerce voted to expand reagan s authority to block foreign takeovers of u s companies reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be damaging to u s economic or national security interests we are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of our national security subcommittee chairman james florio a new jersey democrat said the subcommittee also called for the administration to consider retaliation against japan for its restrictive government procurement practices the retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that the administration investigate whether u s companies were treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr kansai airport construction u s firms have complained they were not allowed to bid on its construction at the urging of the u s recording industry the subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new japanese product digital audio recorders meeting in closed session the house ways and means committee agreed to allow president reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to u s telecommunications products congressional aides said the committee also agreed u s companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of counterfeit products made in violation of u s copyright and patent laws japan

the ministry of international trade and industry will ask japanese computer microchip makers to further slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its semiconductor pact with the united states miti officials said the united states has accused japan of reneging on the semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut price japanese chips to asian markets washington has threatened to take retaliatory action after april the pact agreed last year calls on japan to stop selling cut price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of american chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus miti anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement has been pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export last month the ministry asked japanese chip makers to reduce first quarter output by pct to meet that request they had to slash production by pct over the final six weeks of the first quarter if that reduced production level were maintained through to the end of june second quarter output would come in pct below that of the first three months of the year miti officials who declined to be identified said the ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second quarter cutback one said that japanese chip makers are losing ground in asia to south korean and u s competition just as markets there are picking up miti has been criticized privately by some japanese semiconductor makers for what they see as heavy handed attempts to ensure the success of the japan u s chip pact jordan sudan sign mln dlr barter trade pact jordan and sudan signed a barter trade agreement under which they will exchange mln dlrs worth of goods a year sudanese officials said they said sudan will export corn sesame peanuts spices and cow hides while jordan will export cement tomato puree chemicals and pharmaceuticals economic spotlight u s deficit with nics the u s trade deficit with taiwan and korea is expected to widen this year despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries economists said the surpluses that taiwan and korea ran with the u s in will get bigger this time next year the u s will be screaming at those countries about their exports said steve cerier of manufacturers hanover trust co taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the u s after japan and canada while korea is the seventh largest faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in congress the reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against taiwan and korea urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade the thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries nics amid signs the dollar s steep drop against the currencies of japan and most ec nations previously the main focus of the u s drive to cut its trade gap is beginning to close the competiveness gap for american goods u s treasury secretary james baker said recently that he expects a reduction in japan s trade surplus this year but u s manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to taiwan and korea whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark as major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs taiwanese and korean exporters are well placed to take up the slack in the fashionable comment in washington was japan bashing now it s nic bashing said robert chandross of lloyds bank plc asia s four main nics hong kong south korea singapore and taiwan accounted for almost one fifth of the overall billion dlr u s merchandise trade deficit for the u s trade gap with taiwan rose to billion dlrs in from billion in while the bilateral trade deficit with south korea grew to billion from billion and preliminary u s data show that the growth trend is continuing the u s trade shortfall with taiwan was billion dlrs in january up pct from a year earlier the gap with korea was mln dlrs up pct from a year ago lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions korea said it is choosing many of the items on which the u s wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation still south korean trade minister rha woong bae said last week that korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its billion dlr foreign debt for its part taiwan said in january that it will cut tariffs on goods sometime in the second half of and try to diversify exports but vice economic minister wang chien shien said last month that he still does not expect taiwan s trade surplus with the u s will fall in the nics have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods but korea is raising its profile in the area of big ticket manufactured goods notably cars korea expects its auto exports mostly for north america to balloon to units in from zero in the nics exports are almost all manufactured goods when their exports rise it hits the heart of the u s manufacturing base it cuts directly to us and to our customers said bob wendt manager for economic studies at bethlehem steel corp the u s takes pct of korea s computer products exports pct of its electrical appliances and pct of its telecommunications equipment a recent study by morgan guaranty trust co says taiwan and south korea are the most pressing trade issue for the u s while hong kong and singapore run trade surpluses with the u s these are offset by their deficits with other countries but taiwan and to a lesser extent south korea stand in marked contrast both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the u s and major overrall trade and current account surpluses the morgan study says morgan expects taiwan s overall trade surplus to grow to billion dlrs in from billion last year and korea s to increase to billion dlrs from billion concern about the nics is not confined to the u s a lot of korea and taiwan s exports to the u s have been at japan s expense said richard koss at general motors corp february s paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted nics to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies but this two pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and in any case will only work with a sizeable lag economists say the u s has not said how much it thinks the taiwan s and korea s currencies should climb the taiwan dollar which is pegged to the u s dollar has risen about pct since september while the korean won has risen about five pct but in real terms the taiwan dollar has been flat against the u s unit and the won has lost seven pct economists say we ve not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes said bethlehem steel s wendt and so far u s pleas for taiwan and korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect moreover it is uncertain how far u s protectionism will get given the administration s free trade stance it s hard to see that anything will be passed much before year end and then the question is will it have teeth one economist said ec official faults u s trade bill sir roy denman head of the ec delegation in washington said pending u s trade legislation is a misguided attempt to deal with the nation s trade deficit and will spark retaliation if passed in its present form to think that you can deal with a trade deficit by legislation is a mistake he told the foreign trade association here denman told reporters that possible retaliation which he warned of in a letter to house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski would not necessarily be on a product for product basis retaliation does not have to be matched product to product denman said he said in the case of textiles import restrictions however retaliation would be against u s textile exports certainly if restrictions were imposed on european exports of textiles to the u s the community would be likely to retaliate with restrictions on u s textile exports to europe denman said he also took exception to u s proposals to require countries with large current account surpluses with the u s to cut those surpluses or face special tariffs this would conflict with international obligations throw a large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations and could easily boomerang he warned of the tariff proposals denman also took exception to u s efforts to seek reciprocity in specific trade sectors forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers would simply lead to retaliation from the other party he said adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in another senate wants japan semiconducter pact enforced the u s senate has unanimously called for president reagan immediately to force japan to live up to a pledge to stop dumping its microchips and open its markets to u s chipmakers the senate voted to to urge reagan to impose penalties on japanese high technology products containing semiconductors in retaliation for what it sees as japan s violations of the semiconductor pact while the measure does not bind reagan to any action senate leaders said its adoption would warn japan stiffer legislation would be considered if the violations continue we want to send a message to japan to let it know how the senate feels about this matter senate democratic leader robert byrd told the senate senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen told the senate the measure was not aimed at retaliation but at correcting japan s unfair trade practices a key house trade lawmaker representative richard gephardt also announced he would seek to force japan and other countries with huge trade surpluses to slash their surplus by pct a year for three years taiwan s export orders fall in february export orders for taiwanese products fell pct to billion u s dlrs in february from billion in january but rose nearly pct from billion a year earlier an economic ministry official said he attributed the fall to the rising taiwan dollar february orders for electric and electronic goods were mln u s dlrs up from mln in january and mln in february garment orders were mln dlrs against mln and mln while footwear orders were mln compared with mln and mln taiwan plans mission to close trade gap with u s taiwan s leading industrial organisation said it will send its first buying mission to the u s later this year in an effort to reduce the country s trade surplus with washington a spokesman for the chinese national federation of industries told reuters the mission was part of a broader plan to switch large purchases to the u s from japan the federation groups all of taiwan s major industrial associations last year its members purchased about billion u s dlrs worth of industrial products from japan and about billion from the u s the spokesman said federation members were now discussing the volume of business they could transfer to america he said they had drawn up a list of about industrial products they would be shopping for in the u s during the buying mission in september but he could give no figure on how much would be spent a board of foreign trade official told reuters the government would send two buying missions to america between june and july this year and might send others later taiwan s trade surplus with the u s rose to a record billion dlrs last year from

force japan and other countries with huge trade surpluses to slash their surplus by pct a year for three years japan says oecd study on subsidies still ongoing japanese agriculture ministry officials said a study of agriculture subsidies by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd is still under way and will be completed sometime next month the officials said the study has been inaccurate so far and they said japan would comment on the final results a reuter report from washington yesterday said the study has found that japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies the study has not been officially released due to objections from some countries japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the release of the study the agriculture ministry officials said oecd directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting in mid may one agriculture ministry source said the study so far was based on the years japanese subsidies have dropped sharply since then partly because of tight budgetary policy and foreign currency factors have also changed he said the study is unfair and unacceptable because it does not take account of various differences in farming conditions in each country such as geography the source said he said it is highly likely that the final study will show japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world this would increase foreign pressure to open japan s farm market further but this would have little impact on japan s agriculture policy he said without giving further details a main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies by major exporting nations like the united states and the european community but japan is a major importer he said ec and comecon ends talks with progress the european community ec and soviet led comecon ended talks here having made progress on setting up formal trade relations but no breakthrough because of comecon s refusal to recognise west berlin as part of the ec delegates said negotiators were trying to reach agreement on the draft of a joint declaration setting up official relations after years of mutual non recognition john maslen head of the ec delegation told reuters as he emerged from the final session we made some progress but we have called for another meeting officials who asked not to be named said the comecon team had refused to accept a clause in the draft declaration which would recognise west berlin as part of the nation ec under the treaty of rome all contracts and agreements signed by the community must contain this territorial clause stipulating west berlin is an integral part of the ec an ec negotiator taking part in the three day talks said we wanted the territorial clause in but comecon said no a joint statement issued after the talks said progress was made towards clarifying positions but another meeting would be necessary to complete the work any decision in principle to set up relations would require approval by the community s council of ministers and by the executive committee of comecon zdzislaw kuroski deputy director of comecon who heads the east bloc delegation told reuters ahead of today s session we have narrowed our differences on a range of questions but not on all questions asked whether comecon would accept ec insistence that any joint declaration stipulate west berlin as part of the community he replied this question is not contained in the draft which our side presented west german diplomats said they would insist on including the clause on west berlin in any ec comecon agreement the talks followed an earlier round between the two trading blocs here last september and the first ever direct talks between the ec and the soviet union on establishing diplomatic relations in january the ec trades with individual comecon member states despite non recognition of comecon last year the ec had a five billion dlr trade deficit with east european states about half the deficit of the previous year due to a drop in the price of soviet oil imported by the ec ec says u s broke trade rules in akzo dupont row the european community commission has charged the united states with breaking international trade rules by excluding dutch made fibres from the u s market and said it would take the issue to the world trade body gatt in the latest of a series of trade disputes with washington the executive authority alleged that a section of the u s tariff act was incompatible with the gatt general agreement on tariffs and trade because it discriminated against imported products in favour of domestically produced goods the commission said it would ask geneva based gatt to rule on whether the section in question which officials said had proved a barrier to many ec exporters conformed to its rules commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures if after a gatt decision against it washington failed to bring the disputed section into line with international rules the executive s decision to go to gatt follows a complaint to it by the dutch company akzo akzo as whose aramid synthetic fibres have been banned from the u s market because of charges by the u s firm dupont that the fibres violate the american company s patents akzo alleged that the ban imposed by the u s international trade commission itc was discriminatory and incompatible with gatt provisions the dispute centres on the fact that section of the u s tariff act gives the itc jurisdiction over imported products the ec commission charged that ec producers did not have the same possibilities for defending themselves before the itc as they would have in a normal u s court consequently the procedure followed is less favourable than that which takes places in normal courts of law for goods produced in the united states it said in a statement gatt to debate u s charges of airbus subsidies the u s will pursue its complaint that european governments unfairly subsidise the airbus industrie aircraft consortium in proceedings at the gatt civil aircraft committee a gatt spokesman said today the u s presented its case for the first time to the aircraft committee of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt during a special two day session ending today gatt rules cover some pct of world commerce the member committee agreed to open debate on the u s complaint starting with informal consultations and then holding a special session in july trade officials said the tension has eased the permanent trade ambassador of the member european community tran van thinh told reporters the u s has decided to go through proper channels u s trade officials again made clear their anger over what they call unfair government support for airbus voiced during a visit to european capitals in february in a letter calling for the special committee meeting washington charged france west germany the u k spain and the ec commission with unfair practices on behalf of airbus the u s charges that the europeans are violating rules laid down in the agreement on trade in civil aircraft washington presented its reading of rules on inducement to purchase aircraft and support for development of airlines during the special session and asked the committee to confirm its view official sources in the delegations said the u s views would be considered during the informal consultations but the europeans would also be free to bring up any complaints against american civil aircraft practices some delegates said the u s position appeared to give such broad interpretation to the rules as to suggest that the civil aircraft accord needed re negotiating all these matters would be considered during the informal meetings japan opens home market to u s fish japan has agreed to drop barriers to american caught herring and pollock opening the way for shipments that could reach mln dlrs annually u s trade representative clayton yeutter announced yeutter said the accord was reached after extensive bilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in tokyo he said the commerce department estimated u s shipments of processed pollock products and herring should rise to mln dlrs this year and to more than mln dlrs annually in later years there was no immediate assessment of the value of current u s shipments but officials said the pact would lift quotas to the point that americans would be able to ship nearly all the pollock and herring ordered by japanese firms at the same time yeutter said washington was temporarily suspending a complaint with the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt that japan was unfairly curbing imports of the two fish he said the complaint would be reviewed later this year after an assessment to see if japan lived up to the agreement canada s clark sees trade as most urgent problem trade is the most urgent problem facing u s canadian relations because of a pressing need to reach a new bilateral pact within the coming months joe clark canadian secretary of state for external affairs said negotiators for the two countries have been meeting for more than a year in an effort to work out an agreement the most urgent problem now is the trade question because that has to be decided within the next months clark told the commonwealth club of california we have a fast track authority from your congress for approval or rejection of whatever the negotiators achieve clark said that as a practical matter an initial agreement must be reached by late september or early october he listed environmental questions particularly acid rain and defense as the second and third most important bilateral issues facing ottawa and washington on wednesday president reagan announced that he will seek billion dlrs from congress to address the acid rain problem some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture in advance of his annual meeting on april in ottawa with prime minister brian mulroney in a question and answer session with the public affairs group clark said that the two countries must find better mechanisms for resolving their trade disputes this rash of countervailing actions where we acted on corn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they were quasijudicial the dispute resolution mechanisims in place now are not working adequately in either of our interests he said ottawa also is seeking to change some of washington s rules on government procurement that penalize canadian businesses he said there are a number of canadian companies that in order to secure substantial contracts in the united states have had to move their head offices out of our country into your country because you have national procurement requirements he said in turn he added the united states would like to change some of the procurement requirements that exist at the provincial government level in canada clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions what will come out of it remains for the negotiators in the first instance to propose and then governments and congresses will have judge he said in his prepared remarks clark said that the united states has tended to take canada for granted although it exports to its northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to japan yet you bought almost per cent more from japan last year than you bought from canada he said reuter u s senators say sanctions likely on microchips the united states will likely impose sanctions soon on imports of japanese microchips senators said today after a private meeting with commerce secretary malcolm baldrige although the senators said baldrige told them no decision would be taken until a final determination is made on whether japanese microchips were dumped in the united states they said they were virtually sure japan would face penalties president reagan s trade policy advisory group of which baldrige is a member will meet on the issue wednesday i am confident we will see action taken sen john mccain an arizona republican told reporters i am expecting sanctions at least and even more than sanctions sen pete domenici a new mexico republican said the senators several congressmen and u s semiconductor industry representatives met with baldrige and state department officials to discuss japan s alleged violations of a september agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the united states and other countries they recommended japanese firms be penalized through tariffs or import duties over the next six to months for continuing to dump microchips the violations were worth mln dls to the japanese semiconductor industry they said asked if baldrige intended to recommend sanctions sen pete wilson told reporters the clear import of what he said is that there will be japan can t just say they will comply we think sanctions must be applied for past violations of the agreement the california republican said the semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips which are used in high technology products ranging from radios to defence missile guidance systems sen james mcclure an idaho republican said baldrige told them the administration had not made a final determination that japanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below the cost of production in the united states or other countries but mcclure said senators told him there is no doubt dumping is going on based on evidence such as invoices of purchases of the japanese products the two countries signed a pact last september in which japan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the united states and other countries below production costs and to allow the u s semiconductor industry access to the japanese market in return the united states waived its right to impose import duties on the japanese microchips japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact and have asked japanese chip makers to further slash output to save the pact japan has frequently been the target of congressional discouragement over last year s record billion dlr trade deficit tokyo had a billion dlr surplus with the united states last year and had large surpluses with other countries the senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolution calling for action against japan for violations of the pact since september the resolution will be introduced in the house next week by rep bob matsui a california democrat next world trade negotiations must succeed nz ministers from more than nations were told by new zealand that the next international negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this century and the cost of failure could not be measured trade minister mike moore told his colleagues at a welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which must not be sidetracked we live in troubled and dangerous times for the world trading system he said we have seen that the failure of the world trading system has caused great depression and conflict in the past our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all moore said he added the cost of failure is beyond calculation it is our last hope and best opportunity this century we will not get another chance before the year the ministers are in new zealand to review world trade since the uruguay round talks last sepember the meeting is also part of preparations for a full scale conference of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in venice in june the uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round the southerners goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met the meeting at this north island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected moore said one aim was to instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits as well as preventing bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations the meeting is being attended by overseas delegations including representatives of gatt and the economic community the delegates include u s trade representative clayton yeutter american sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the united states is to implement four key uruguay proposals an end to agricultural subsidies inclusion of trade in services and investments in gatt regulations tightening of restrictions on pirating of so called intellectual property such as trademarks patents and copyrights new rules to resolve trade disputes among gatt s member states earlier new zealand sources had said french foreign trade minister michel noir had pulled out of the informal gatt talks for domestic political reasons cabinet chief bernard prauge will lead the french delegation gatt success will take pressure n z minister long term pressure by trade ministers is necessary if the current uruguay round of talks on the general agreement on trade and tariffs gatt is to succeed new zealand s overseas trade minister mike moore said moore told the opening meeting of trade ministers from nations gathered for informal talks on the gatt that ministers need opportunities to keep in touch and to consider how the political problems inherent in an exercise like this one can be faced and resolved moore said the taupo meeting is one of a series of such international gatherings which includes the oecd ministerial meeting in may and the g meeting in venice in june enabling ministers to maintain contact world trade conditions are getting better not worse he said he said new zealand is moving rapidly and of our own initiative in the direction of liberalisation and i warn you we shall be looking for partners yeutter sees u s japan verging on trade conflict the united states and japan are on the brink of serious conflict on trade especially over semiconductors japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy u s super computers and barriers to u s firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr kansai airport project u s trade representative clayton yeutter said he was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the uruguay meeting last september launched a new round of gatt general agreement on tariffs and trade talks european community ec commissioner willy de clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world s three major trading and economic powers the ec the u s and japan set a poor example for other members of gatt australian trade minister john dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes new zealand trade minister mike moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of gatt negotiations which must not be sidetracked the ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years countries don t get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is maybe five or six years in the future he also said he did not consider the new u s congress as protectionist as it was months ago that s a very healthy development he added if you asked me about that a year or months ago i would have said that it was terribly protectionist members of congress that is the contemplative members of congress have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the billion dlr trade deficit yeutter said they ve also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and in my judgement more responsible on that issue than they were or months ago he added whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter philippines posts mln dlr january trade deficit the philippines posted a trade deficit of mln dlrs in january compared with deficits of mln in january and mln in december government figures show the national census and statistics office ncso said imports of mln dlrs in january were up from mln in january and mln dlrs in december while exports of mln were up on the mln in january but lower than december s mln the country s medium term development plan targets a pct average annual growth in exports and a pct growth in imports the ncso said japan says it trying to expand domestic demand japan has assured a meeting of trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domestic demand and restructure its economy japanese trade representative tsomu hata told an informal general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt meeting that in addition to demand boosting measures adopted last september a comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the budget is approved hata speaking at the first session of the two day meeting said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring the economy but did not elaborate hata said protectionist pressures in the international economy are as strong as ever reflecting financial deficits payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries despite great potential developing economies are still confronted by grave difficulties particularly debt he added the basis for the talks is the gatt ministerial declaration last september in punta del este uruguay and the subsequent trade negotiating plan agreed in geneva it is essential that we first reaffirm here our commitment to implementing that plan as scheduled hata said hata added it is not constructive to speed up negotiations in some areas at the expense of others in order to rebuild the free trade system it is important for each participant to have domestic policies that will serve this end as part of its contribution japan plans in april to fundamentally improve its generalised system of preferences for industrial and mining products to make japan s domestic market more open to developing countries he said australian minister says agriculture gatt priority australian trade minister john dawkins said if the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt does not give high priority to agricultural trade reform it will be neglecting the area of greatest crisis in a statement to the informal gatt trade ministers conference here he said agriculture is a problem which involves all countries and seriously affects the debt servicing abilities of a number of developing countries he said major countries should be showing leadership on this problem we will be giving close attention to the processes in the oecd organisation of economic cooperation and development and elsewhere leading to the venice economic summit where we will be looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment to agricultural trade reform dawkins said the venice summit is scheduled for june he said australia s interests in the uruguay round the eighth under the gatt are wide ranging dawkins said he sees the round as providing a timely opportunity to secure further meaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restore confidence in the multilateral system dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groups established in geneva after the gatt declaration last september in punta del este uruguay have made a reasonable start but it is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on these processes we must see that the commitments made at punta del este on standstill and rollback are carried into practice the standstill and rollback of protection offers the global trading system a chance to hold and wind back protection during the negotiations which are expected to last up to four years he said yeutter sees u s japan verging on trade conflict the united states and japan are on the brink of serious conflict on trade especially

delegations including representatives of gatt and the economic community the delegates include u s trade representative clayton yeutter american sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the united states is to implement four key uruguay proposals an end to agricultural subsidies inclusion of trade in services and investments in gatt regulations tightening of restrictions on pirating of so called intellectual property such as trademarks patents and copyrights new rules to resolve trade disputes among gatt s member states earlier new zealand

nigerian trade minister samaila mamman said today he told an informal meeting of the general agreement on tariffs and trade the widening gap between industrialized and developing countries and an unfair international economic system were major obstacles to growth in developing countries i wish to emphasize that the growth in the volume of the external indebtedness of african countries reflects the full effect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of the developed market economy countries mamman said delegates from countries are attending the talks of the world trade body in the new zealand resort of taupo japan says it trying to expand domestic demand japan has assured a meeting of trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domestic demand and restructure its economy japanese trade representative tsomu hata told an informal general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt meeting that in addition to demand boosting measures adopted last september a comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the budget is approved hata speaking at the first session of the two day meeting said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring the economy but did not elaborate hata said protectionist pressures in the international economy are as strong as ever reflecting financial deficits payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries japan in last ditch effort to save chip pact japan has launched a last ditch effort to salvage its computer micro chip pact with the united states sending a letter to top american policy makers setting out its case and instructing its producers to cut output further we must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe ministry of international trade and industry miti deputy director general masaji yamamoto told reporters if hasty action is taken in the united states it will create very serious problems the reagan administration s economic policy is expected to meet thursday to review japanese compliance with the bilateral agreement hammered out last year under the pact tokyo agreed to stop selling cut price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of american semiconductors washington has accused japan of reneging on the deal by selling low priced chips in asia and by failing to boost american imports and has threatened to take retaliatory action in an effort to save the agreement miti is asking japanese chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export yamamoto said that japan will slash output of kilobit dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only memory chips by pct in the second quarter this follows a cutback of more than pct in the first three months of the year he said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of chips available for export through unregulated distributors in the so called grey market we have almost no grey market he said supply is diminishing to help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented miti called in the president of japan s largest semiconductor maker nec corp nipn t last week he said it is also issuing specific instructions on production to the japanese subsidiary of texas instruments inc trade and industry minister hajime tamura spelled out the steps japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for u s understanding in a letter to top american policy makers the letter was sent today to u s secretary of state george schultz treasury secretary james baker commerce secretary malcolm baldrige and u s trade representative clayton yeutter the four who make up the economic policy council are expected to consider evidence presented by u s chip maker micron technology inc dram o of cut price japanese sales in hong kong yamamoto admitted that oki electric industry co s hong kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but denied that it was dumping chips at rock bottom prices if the united states uses this as proof of dumping we will present our rebuttal he said the sales though were inappropriate in the light of miti s advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above production costs to avoid any hint of dumping he said he also called the case strange but he stopped short of endorsing japanese newspaper accusations that oki had been trapped into making the sales he did say though that micron publicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day they were made and that oki was unable to locate the person who had bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week amstutz says farm trade accord possible in u s agriculture undersecretary daniel amstutz said it is possible to reach a global agreement to scale back agricultural supports in calendar speaking to a senate agriculture appropriations committee hearing amstutz said i think we can reach agreement in calendar amstutz said the u s places a high priority on the uruguay round of global trade talks his comments followed a statement by secretary of state george shultz last week urging agriculture be the highest priority item during the upcoming summit of western heads of state in venice italy yeutter sees gatt consensus on farm trade reform u s trade representative clayton yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture delegates from countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest gatt round was launched in punta del este uruguay last september yeutter said at least people seem to be going down the same road but how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely there seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there yeutter said however the hard work is still to come with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead he said it is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy he said he said the long term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas this would help agriculture because some its inefficient non productive segments would stop operating he said individual segments in many countries may lose in the process but it should result in a more rational system of world wide production within or years he said it is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the u s is spending billion dlrs a year and the european community probably more than that which is an ineffective use of financial resources he said asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations he said one has to be politically realistic if there is any chance of getting it agricultural trade reform done in two to three years it s going to have to be as part of a larger package gatt round may stop growing trade problems u s a successful new gatt general agreement on tariffs and trade round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners u s trade representative clayton yeutter said yeutter in new zealand for informal gatt ministerial talks told reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient that is really a strong rationale why we need a new gatt round he said the very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems the eighth gatt round of negotiations was launched at punta del este in uruguay in september agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time the growing debt burden of latin american and african nations will also provide impetus for the gatt round to succeed he said clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that s the basic objective of the new gatt round he said but he said the gatt round is a long term endeavour it will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries but it will make a difference in to years it s a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two he said they ought to be very strongly supported in the gatt round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future he said nakasone intervenes in microchip dispute with u s prime minister yasuhiro nakasone intervened to try to resolve japan s escalating dispute with the u s over semiconductor trade government officials said at today s cabinet meeting nakasone told trade and industry minister hajime tamura to redouble his efforts to calm u s anger over what it sees as japan s unfair trade practices in semiconductors nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the reagan administration s economic policy council to consider whether japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the u s that pact agreed last year after months of negotiations calls on japan to stop selling cut price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of u s semiconductors senior u s officials have accused tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action yesterday tamura s ministry of international trade and industry miti launched a last ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to u s policy makers setting out japan s case and telling japanese chip makers to cut output in his letter the contents of which were released today tamura said a miti survey carried out at the beginning of march showed japanese producers were not selling at cut rate prices in asian markets in a separate letter sent to senior u s officials miti vice minister for international affairs makoto kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of japanese chip dumping in such markets yeutter says u s japan trade difficulties remain u s trade representative clayton yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade issues straining u s japanese relations would be resolved before the two countries open trade talks in late april we are having high level discussions on them the issues within the united states the relationship on some of those is very strained between us japan at the moment and we need to relieve those strains at the earliest possible date he said i am not sure we can wait until late april he added yeutter is in new zealand for a two day informal meeting of trade ministers who are reviewing the uruguay round of the general agreement on trade and tariffs gatt he said he will meet the japanese delegation over the next few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the strain between the two countries yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade issues were semiconductors japanese government unwillingness to allow public entities to buy u s super computers and the barring of u s firms from the eight billion u s dlr kansai airport project near osaka the japanese delegation to the gatt talks said in a statement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantle trade barriers in their country i am convinced that they are attempting to move their policies in the right direction the question is how far and how fast yeutter said german february import prices fall import prices in west germany fell pct in february from january to stand pct below their level in february the federal statistics office said in january the import price index base was unchanged compared with december but pct lower against january february export prices same base as import prices were unchanged compared with january and pct lower than in february in january export prices fell pct against december to stand pct lower than in january canada outlines gatt agricultural reform plan canadian trade minister pat carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world international trade and should therefore become more price responsive over time she told delegates at the informal meeting of trade ministers that this was one of five principles canada wanted adopted in reforming agriculture in the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt secondly support for agriculture should avoid production incentives and thirdly countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices carney said carney said the fourth principle was that countries should not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must be implemented collectively carney later told reuters the canadian guidelines are basically compatible with the seven point australian proposals announced in davos switzerland in january european trade sources said the conference welcomed the canadian initiative but some delegates and not only the european community voiced reservations about some of the principles carney said there was a lot of political will among the ministers here to complete the uruguay round of gatt in under four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to be done in a balanced way the consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early conclusion she said however the meeting did not identify what those areas are carney said she said canada u s bilateral trade negotiations which must be concluded at least in draft form by october are progressing well philippine trade secretary pleased with gatt talks philippine secretary of trade and industry jose concepcion who two days ago expressed doubts about agreements produced at international conferences said he was pleased with the latest gathering here concepcion told reuters in an interview that the informal general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt meeting gave ministers from more than nations the chance to examine issues with which gatt did not have the political will to deal also the role of the developing countries has been emphasised in this particular meeting somehow it has been the perception of developing countries that gatt is a club of rich countries he added in an interview with reuters in fact many of the issues that have been tabled for discussion in the uruguay round of trade negotiations will be of more benefit to the developed countries he said concepcion said at the start of the taupo meeting that the uruguay round was meant to be a shining act of faith in the world trade system concepcion said the philippines would address the issues of trade in tropical fruit and the improvement of gatt machinery to make it more responsive he said tropical fruit came from developing countries but faced non tariff barriers quantitative restrictions or very high duties in other nations concepcion named japan and south korea as examples he said he would go to wellington for talks with new zealand which had a surplus in trade with the philippines to encourage it to switch imports from other countries he noted that new zealand bought its bananas from ecuador yeutter sees gatt consensus on farm trade reform u s trade representative clayton yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on

s sixth largest debtor to fresh measures to deregulate trade and dismantle protectionist barriers we would like to see the indonesian government continue the adjustment process to move towards increased deregulation of the economy conable told a press conference at the end of a three day visit to jakarta conable directly linked further bank help for indonesia s hard pressed balance of payments to further measures by the government to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency the world bank last month granted indonesia a mln dlr trade adjustment loan he said further loans would depend on the economic policies indonesia adopted but he said that in meetings with both president suharto and leading indonesian ministers he had not called for specific policy changes the initiative will have to rest with the indonesian government we are not here to dictate to them he stated indonesia the only asian member of opec has been badly hit by last year s slump in oil prices which cut its revenues from crude exports in half conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning with suharto he voiced support for measures already taken including september s pct devaluation of the rupiah and efforts to deregulate imports and stimulate exports the government can rely on the support of the world bank in a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of today s world he said the bank has loaned indonesia billion dlrs over the past years lending is now about one billion a year the world bank would probably like to see further dismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce indonesia s protected monopolies in areas like steel plastics and cement western bankers and diplomats said the government has already said it will announce further deregulation measures but has given no timetable it is also considering selling off loss making state companies conable said the bank would try to help indonesia find funds to cover its share of development

goods u s house panel eases soviet export controls the u s house foreign affairs committee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now kept from shipment to soviet bloc countries but are no longer a threat to u s national security the democratic controlled committee said the administration s export control policies which restrict shipment of thousands of products contributed to last year s record billion dlr u s trade deficit the committee said the legislation will cut government red tape and make it easier for u s companies to compete with foreign producers since many of the goods are readily available from other countries rep don bonker chairman of the international economic policy subcommittee said the unnecessary restrictions had cost the u s billion dlrs in exports a year this is congress number one opportunity to attack the trade deficit in a positive way by exporting more the washington democrat said the legislation would order the commerce department to lift controls on pct of goods on the restricted export list over the next three years unless other countries agree to comparable controls most of these are of the least sophisticated type of technology such as medical instruments it would also give the commerce department primary authority to decide which exports will be permitted and limit the defense department to an advisory role in reviewing requests to export highly sensitive technology unionist urges retaliation against japan william bywater president of the international union of electronic workers called on president reagan to retaliate against japan for unfair practices in semiconductor trade he said in a statement a crash program was needed in the semiconductor industry to prevent the united states from becoming one of the world s industrial lightweights bywater s remarks came as the white house economic policy council prepared for a thursday meeting to decide what sanctions if any should be taken against japan for alleged violations of a u s japanese semiconductors agreement the pact agreed to last july called for tokyo to end selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home market to u s goods in return washington agreed to forego antidumping duties on japanese semiconductors but u s officials have said that while japan has stopped dumping in the u s market it has not ended third country dumping nor has it opened its market to u s semiconductors japan yesterday in an effort to ward off u s action ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to force prices up and end the dumping bywater in his statement said he backed a defense science board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the u s industory more competitive but he added the industry could not wait for legislation to pass and that action was required now to help the depressed electronic industry bywater said i urge the reagan administration to take full and severe action immediately against japan by invoking the retaliatory steps that are permitted under u s law and gatt general agreement on tariffs and trade brazil computer market to remain closed minister brazilian science and technology minister renato archer said brazil will keep its computer market closed to foreign goods in order to give its own infant industry time to develop every country establishes laws to protect its interests the united states closed their borders at a certain stage to some foreign goods and therefore protected its industrial development now it is time for brazil to do likewise archer said at the opening of a national software conference after several meetings brazil and the u s have made no major progress in their computer row which they have been trying to resolve for the past months the reagan administration has objected to brazil protecting its computer industry from imports canada vows to fight u s potash action external affairs minister joe clark today vowed to do everything possible to fight the u s action against canadian potash exports but also warned against raising the alarm too early in the dispute in the latest flashpoint in canadian u s trade relations the u s international trade commission ruled unanimously monday that canadian potash shipments valued at million u s dlrs last year were injuring the u s industry we certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that canadian interests are well protected clark told the house of commons in the daily question period but he said the opposition parties should be careful not to raise false alarms too early the case now goes before the u s commerce department s trade division to determine if a duty should be imposed potash producers from new mexico claiming unfair government subsidies are seeking a pct tariff on canada s shipments canada the world s largest potash producer exported mln metric tonnes of potash last year with nearly a third going to the u s most of the potash used in the production of fertilizer comes from provincially owned mines in saskatchewan in the commons liberal member lloyd axworthy branded the ruling as just another trade harrassment from the u s and criticized clark s assurances the country s interests would be protected we received exactly the same kind of assurances in the softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled axworthy said canada s progressive conservative government agreed to impose a pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier this year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with the u s axworthy urged the government to present canada s case to world trade authorities under the general agreement on tariffs and trade but clark maintained the potash dispute was another example of why canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral irritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the u s what we are seeking to do is put in place a better system clark said meanwhile saskatchewan trade minister bob andrew expressed confidence canada would win its case claiming the problem stems from low international commodity prices and not government subsidies the reality of the problem and the injury is caused worldwide he said it s caused by a downturn in the commodity price for fertilizer whether it s potash fertilizer nitrogen fertilizer or whatever n z trade surplus mln dlrs in february preliminary trade figures for february show an excess of exports over imports of mln n z dlrs a statistics department statement said this compares with a mln dlr deficit revised from mln in january and a mln dlr deficit in february exports rose to mln dlrs from mln revised from in january and in february imports dropped to an estimated

into january deficit the belgo luxembourg economic union recorded a provisional trade deficit of billion francs in january after a december surplus of billion francs revised upwards from a provisional surplus of billion the national statistics office said in january the union recorded a deficit of billion francs january imports fell to a provisional billion francs from billion in december and

expected to nearly double to mln u s dlrs in calendar and rise to mln dlrs a year by a five year forecast by the economic ministry showed taiwanese investment in the u s last year totalled mln dlrs the ministry document said the investment was mainly in electronics trading food and service industries lee ming yi deputy director of the ministry s industrial development and investment centre said the forecast rise is due to planned government incentives and growing willingness among taiwanese to invest abroad lee told reuters the incentives to be introduced in may or june include bank loans and a reduction in capitalisation requirements for businesses seeking to invest in the u s to mln taiwan dlrs from mln he said the moves to encourage investment in the u s are part of taiwan s efforts to cut its trade surplus with washington which rose to a record billion u s dlrs in from s billion taiwanese manufacturers can create jobs for americans and avoid import quotas if they set up plants in the u s he added china to tighten import control cut export costs china should tighten imports of ordinary goods and restrict or even forbid import of goods which can be made domestically premier zhao ziyang said he told the national people s congress china s parliament that the country s foreign exchange is limited and must be used where it is most needed we should expand production of import substitutes and increase their proportion he said on exports china should increase its proportion of manufactured goods especially textiles light industrial goods electronics and machinery he said zhao said china should lower the cost of exports and control the export of goods that incur too much loss in china had a trade deficit of billion dlrs down from a record billion in zhao said china should work to provide a more favourable investment environment for foreign businessmen it should use foreign funds for production and construction with stress on firms making goods for export or import substitutes china should also earn more foreign exchange from tourists and contracted labour abroad he added house ways and means cmte finishes work on bill to toughen trade laws key u s house panel finishes major trade bill the house ways and means committee completed action on legislation to toughen u s trade laws chairman dan rostenkowski said the committee s consideration of one of the most controversial provisions a plan to force major trade surplus countries to cut their trade imbalance with the united states was deferred until the full house considers the trade bill its sponsor rep richard gephardt said gephardt a missouri democrat told reuters he was not certain the exact form his trade surplus reduction proposal would take last year the house approved his plan to force a pct surplus cutback each year for four years by countries such as japan the ways and means committess trade bill forces president reagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violate international trade agreements but it allows him to wave retaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the u s economy the trade bill gives u s trade representative clayton yeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisions to grant domestic industries import relief it also gives him authority to decide whether foreign trade practices are unfair and violate u s trading rights these powers are currently held by president reagan the administration has strongly objected to this transfer of authority from reagan to yeutter the bill also extends u s authority to negotiate multilateral trade agreements the bill will be wrapped into other trade legislation and voted on in the house in april baldrige says japan must open its markets commerce secretary malcolm baldrige said the united states will not stand idly by and let japan dominate the world electronics market baldrige told the senate finance committee the united states would insist japan open its markets to u s products as the u s market is open to japanese products asked after his testimony if this meant the united states would close its markets to japan if they did not open theirs baldrige said i m not prepared to say that but it certainly would be one of the alternatives studied baldrige said in his testimony japan had a closed supercomputer market and a restricted telecommunications market i can only conclude that the common objective of the japanese government and industry is to dominate the world electronics market given the importance of this market to u s industry in general and our defense base in particular we cannot stand by idly he said he said it was these concerns about national security which led him to express reservations over the proposed acquisition of fairchild semiconductor by fujitsu of japan treasury s baker says exchange rate changes will reduce trade deficit this year treasury s baker outlines trade bill criticisms treasury secretary james baker said that some of the trade bills proposed by congress conflict significantly with certain basic principles the reagan administration considers critical baker told a senate committee that the administration would resist such measures as a general import surcharge sector specific protection such as import quotas for individual products mandatory retaliation and limits on presidential discretion in negotiating more open markets abroad and other trade steps u s senate trade leader concerned about canada the chairman of the u s senate committee with jurisdiction over trade said he was concerned about a resolution on bilateral trade negotiations adopted by the canadian house of commons last week the resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral trading agreement with the united states while protecting canadian political sovereignty social programs agricultural marketing systems the auto industry and canada s cultural identity senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen said the resolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed free trade agreement between the two countries which are each other s largest trading partners we need a truly free trade agreement which means both countries have to work toward a deal that is mutually beneficial and comprehensive a large agreement the texas democrat said in a statement i do not question canada s right to protect its political sovereignty or cultural identity however if these phrases mean the government of canada means to take important economic issues off the table in these negotiations i am deeply concerned he added bentsen said canada restricts trade different ways while the united states uses only six trade restriction methods he said if canada proposes an agreement where both countries get rid of six methods of trade restriction it would not be fair and might not win senate approval i am deeply concerned that when the president visits prime minister brian mulroney next month he will be presented with this kind of argument and i hope he makes it clear as i did when i was in canada that only a mutually beneficial agreement will be successful bentsen said reagan and mulroney are scheduled to meet april in ottawa bentsen urged mulroney to withdraw a proposal that would ban imports of independently produced films into canada by non canadians which the senator called a protectionist measure baldrige sees u s trade deficit starting to decline in feb or march data baldrige sees u s trade gap dropping soon commerce secretary malcolm baldrige said the u s trade deficit should start to decline soon possibly in the figures for february or march we could see the trade deficit start down in february or march baldrige said in an appearance before the senate governmental affairs committee he predicted the trade deficit which was billion dlrs in would decline by to billion dlrs in and in baldrige said he was making his prediction without having seen the february trade figures but he said that the volume of imports has dropped beginning with the fourth quarter of and will continue to drop in this quarter the eventual turnaround in the monthly trade figures will reflect the impact of the decline in the dollar baldrige said ealier treasury secretary james baker told the committee that the trade deficit had levelled off but baldrige said he was more optimistic adding i think we turned the corner in february u s chipmakers urge sanctions against japan the semiconductor industry association urged the u s government to impose trade sanctions against japan for violating the u s japan semiconductor trade agreement in a letter to treasury secretary james baker the group said sanctions should be imposed against japanese chipmakers as of april and should continue until the united states is satisfied that there is full compliance with the agreement the group said action by japan to cut back on semiconductor exports is not what is required america s interests require that agreements be honored and that u s industries not bear the burden for the persistent unwillingness or inability of the government of japan to deliver on its commitments the trade group said the white house economic policy council is expected to discuss possible sanctions against japan at a meeting scheduled for thursday the trade group said japan has not lived up to the terms of the agreement last year which was aimed at ending japanese dumping of semiconductors and at opening japanese markets to foreign based manufacturers u s chipmakers urge sanctions against japan the

deficit during an interview on cable news network baker said i think you re going to see a to billion dlr reduction this year the deficit was billion dlrs in baker noted that the benefits of a weaker currency take to months to affect the trade balance and said it is now months since the plaza agreement to lower the dollar s value ec links agricultural trade talks to other reform the european community ec considers talks on agricultural trade reform to be inseperable from talks on other trade reform in the present gatt round willy de clercq external relations commissioner of the ec said he told reporters here the ec would not bow to pressure to reach an early seperate agreement on agricultural trade he said the ec wanted to stick to the four year schedule agreed by members of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in punta del este uruguay last year that included agricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the lengthy program to re negotiate the gatt other trade issues being discussed in the current gatt round include reform of trade in merchandise and services de clercq is on his way to china after attending a two day conference for gatt trade ministers held in new zealand several of those ministers criticised the ec for what they saw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for urgent reforms u s trade representative clayton yeutter also said it was important agreement on agricultural trade reform was reached as early as possible but de clercq said the gatt program had been reached after long and hard negotiations and the ec did not want changes we just want to stick to the agreement which was reached and that was very clear that the new round would be one undertaking it is a global negotiation with no two tracks no fast track no slow track it has just one track the track and that s all de clercq said if you start selecting priorities your priority is not my priority we say that agriculture is urgent but it s not the only urgent thing he said he said the punte del este agreement had taken eight months to prepare and eight days of negotiations trade surplus cut would benefit japan sumita bank of japan governor satoshi sumita said it is in japan s national interest to make greater efforts to reduce its trade surplus he told business executives the most important issues for the world economy are the correction of international trade imbalances and a solution to the world debt problem to this end japan and the u s must make medium and long term efforts to alter economic structures which have expanded the trade gap between the two nations world economic growth and therefore an expansion of debtor countries export markets are needed to solve the debt issue he added german february trade surplus billion marks jan surplus billion official no pessimism for german exporters ministry firms need not be pessimistic about export prospects even though foreign markets have become more difficult because of the mark s strength the economics ministry said the ministry s parliamentary state secretary ludolf georg von wartenberg told a business conference german exports could start rising again in real terms during reversing the lower export trend which emerged in mid but even if the turnaround did not occur there would be no need to worry about the economy as long as the weakness of exports did not affect currently good domestic demand von wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good but noted there had been a cooling in the investment climate this is certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not for stimulative steps he said the best way for bonn to help its exporters is to work actively to promote free world trade he added von wartenberg said the economy still had good export opportunities price alone was not the only factor in international competitiveness he said adding german firms have a reputation for high quality standards prompt delivery times and good service von wartenberg said the government was in a difficult position on its trade figures it faced international pressure to reduce its trade surplus but west germans were worried about the effect of the mark s strength on the country s exporters reports about the trade surplus especially overseas tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures which rose to a record billion marks in he said but this rise was due entirely to the lower value of imports caused by the decline of both the dollar and oil prices german exports have in fact been falling in real terms for sometime he said uk feb trade deficit mln stg vs deficit mln in jan official trade surplus cut would benefit japan sumita bank of japan governor satoshi sumita said it is in japan s national interest to make greater efforts to reduce its trade surplus he told business executives the most important issues for the world economy are the correction of international trade imbalances and a solution to the world debt problem to this end japan and the u s must make medium and long term efforts to alter economic structures which have expanded the trade gap between the two nations world economic growth and therefore an expansion of debtor countries export markets are needed to solve the debt issue he added u s treasury s baker opposes tax increase u s treasury secretary james baker said that he opposes a federal tax increase to help reduce the budget deficit and favors spending cuts instead i don t think it s a tax increase is a very good idea and i m quite confident that president reagan doesn t think it s a very good idea baker said in an interview on cable news network s moneyline television program he said u s taxpayers are taxed at a rate of pct of gnp which is traditionally where it has been but the federal government is spending at a rate of pct of gnp baker said spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by house speaker jim wright d tex or other special taxes the stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate approach to take the treasury secretary said he said the united states has some of the most efficient capital markets in the world and new taxes would impair efficiency on the international front baker said banks must do more lending to developing countries he was questioned about this after the standard and poor s corp downgrading today of the debt of six major money center bank holding companies largely because of their heavy developing nation loan exposure baker said that developing countries must adopt free market economic policies such as in the united states he said capital flows will be required to support the needed reforms in the economic systems of those countries the money must come either through equity or debt and baker said that developing nations investment regimes do not support enough equity investment so you ve got to have some debt there commenting on the u s trade deficit baker said i think you re going to see a to billion dlr reduction this year british politicians urge japan trade sanctions one hundred members of britain s ruling conservative party have signed a motion calling for trade sanctions against japan to force tokyo to open its domestic market to british goods the government announced last week that japan had a billion dlr trade surplus with britain in the department of trade and industry said the government was drawing up contingency plans to force japan into opening up its domestic markets but a spokesman said such moves were very much a last resort ideas being considered included blocking japanese companies from trading in britain and revoking licenses of japanese operations in the london financial district white house unit decides on semiconductors the white house economic policy council made a recommendation to president reagan whether to retaliate against japan for alleged unfair practices in semiconductor trade u s officials said they would not disclose the council s recommendation but the officials said earlier it was likely the council would call for retaliation and urge that curbs be imposed on japanese exports to the united states the officials said it might be several days before reagan would act and his moves made public the senate last week unanimously called on reagan to impose penalities on japanese exports retaliation was also called for by the semiconductor industry and its chief trade union both hard hit by japanese semiconductor trade in a pact last summer japan summer agreed to stop dumping its semiconductors at less than cost in the united states and other nations and to open its own market to the u s products in return the united states agreed to hold up imposing anti dumping duties on japanese semiconductor shipments u s officials say that while japan has stopped dumping semiconductors on the american market they have continued to dump them in third countries and that the japanese market has remained all but closed to the u s semiconductors semiconductors on the american market they have continued to dump them in third countries and that the japanese market has remained all but closed to the u s semiconductors gatt warns u s on federal budget protectionism the united states emphasis on its foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country s real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit the general agreeement on tariffs and trade gatt said by stressing its record trade deficit of billion dlrs last year the u s was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system it said in an annual report the fundamental problem the size of the u s federal budget deficit could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt it said gatt also predicted world trade would grow by only pct in a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years gatt experts urged washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit higher private savings lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit raising u s trade barriers would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit it would however increase inflation and reduce world trade it said the basic cause some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit would remain the report said gatt economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in japan and some west european nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar risk of higher u s inflation concerns over third world debt management and looming protectionism the report also said imbalances in the current accounts of japan west germany and the u s had increased in the most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies it added thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year the report said gatt warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the u s inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates which in turn would adversely affect world trade but the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the united states despite the dollar s depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive it suggested that resources idle in the u s both human and in underutilised factories were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad world trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in about half of the rate of the previous year trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade gatt said developing countries exports declined significantly while their imports increased moderately although full statistics are not available yet gatt said the combined export earnings of major indebted nations were sharply lower and only five of them chile colombia philippines south korea and thailand had higher exports white house panel said urging japan retaliation the white house economic policy council decided to recommend trade sanctions against japan for violations of the u s japanese semiconductor agreement industry sources said they would give no details noting that the white house had not commented on the decision the administration has been under pressure to retaliate there was no immediate announcement on the council s decision but u s officials said it was likely the senior policy group s move on curbs reflected growing american frustration over alleged unfair japanese trade practices u s officials said president reagan would probably act on the recommendations in a day or so after consulting with aides on the foreign policy implications of retaliation the officials said reagan might delay retaliation for a last try to persuade japan to abide by the agreement reached last july governing trade in semiconductors under a pact reached last july japan was to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to u s made semiconductors in return the u s agreed to hold up imposing anti dumping duties on japanese semiconductor shipments the united states said that dumping has stopped in the u s market but has continued in third countries and that the japanese market remains closed the pressure on reagan to retaliate included a unanimous call by the senate last week to impose penalties on japanese high technology products containing semiconductors a call for retaliation also came from the semiconductor industry and from its chief trade union u s officials said the most likely move against japan would involve duties on semiconductor based goods such as televisions video cassette recorders and computers nakasone to visit washington in late april prime minister yasuhiro nakasone will make an official week long visit to the united states from april and hold talks in washington with president reagan chief cabinet secretary masaharu gotoda told reporters government sources said nakasone would try to resolve growing bilateral trade friction and discuss the june venice summit of western industrial democracies foreign minister tadashi kuranari will accompany nakasone ministry officials said u s industry sources in washington said the white house economic policy council was recommending trade sanctions against japan for violating the two countries agreement on semiconductor trade under the pact japan pledged to stop dumping microchips in the u s and asia and open its domestic market to u s semiconductors world bank chief urges more japanese investment world bank president barber conable called on japan to boost investment in developing nations for its own sake as well as that of the world economy japan has the means to make a major contribution to development in the third world he told about japanese businessmen and academics i would be pleased with additional support with pct of the world s total banking assets japan could do more to help assist indebted third world countries develop roads bridges and other infrastructure he said conable said additional commercial bank investment would also be to japan s advantage it would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplus into third world economies notably those in south america china and india that are likely to expand faster than those in the developed world he said japan is now the second largest shareholder in the bank s concessionary lending affiliate the international development association ida it has also agreed recently to expand its contribution to another affiliate the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd conable noted conable said the world bank was expanding its structural adjustment loans designed to encourage developing countries to open their economies more to free competition and trade adjustment loans could rise to pct of total world bank loans in the near future though maybe not this year conable told reuters after his speech such loans currently account for slightly over pct nakasone to visit washington in late april prime minister yasuhiro nakasone will make an official week long visit to the united states from april and hold talks in washington with president reagan chief cabinet secretary masaharu gotoda told reporters government sources said nakasone would try to resolve growing bilateral trade friction and discuss the june venice summit of western industrial democracies foreign minister tadashi kuranari will accompany nakasone ministry officials said u s industry sources in washington said the white house economic policy council was recommending trade sanctions against japan for violating the two countries agreement on semiconductor trade under the pact japan pledged to stop dumping microchips in the u s and asia and open its domestic market to u s semiconductors nakasone hard pressed to soothe u s anger on trade prime minister yasuhiro nakasone will visit washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting u s anger over japanese trade policies but western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans nakasone will be hard pressed to come up with anything new to tell u s president ronald reagan and key u s congressmen they said news of the week long visit starting april coincided with news that japan recorded a billion dlr trade surplus last month more than pct higher than a year earlier it also came one day after the reagan administration s economic policy council decided to take retaliatory action against japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages one designed to pep up japan s sagging economy and imports in the short term the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over dependence on exports for growth but government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short term economic measures until after its budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate but his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the u s virtually empty handed nakasone today ordered his ruling liberal democratic party ldp to come up with its own measures he can then tell reagan the ldp package will form the basis of the government s plans without losing face in parliament over the budget political analysts said officials working on the government s short term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations deregulation measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices and accelerated public investment they said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire fiscal year will take place in the first half probably over pct diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy reagan who is under pressure from the democrat controlled u s congress to take greater action to cut the huge american trade deficit to complement the short term measures nakasone is also likely to present reagan with details of japan s longer term economic plans a high ranking advisory body headed by former bank of japan governor haruo maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before nakasone is scheduled to leave for washington its recommendations are designed as a follow up to maekawa s report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy officials said while wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee s recommendations a subcommittee is considering what the japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring officials said the subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of japan s total output or gross national product around or last year the surplus which measures trade in goods and services amounted to over four pct of gnp the subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual appreciation of the yen to about to the dollar by around from now india steps up countertrade deals to cut trade gap india is searching for non communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange wheat tobacco tea coffee jute engineering and electronic goods as well as minerals including iron ore are all on offer in return for crude oil petroleum products chemicals steel and machinery trade sources told reuters most of the impetus behind countertrade which began in comes from two state trading firms the state trading corp stc and the minerals and metals trading corp mmtc the two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote indian exports a commerce ministry spokeswoman said adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading one trade source said india has targetted countries that depend on an indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports however countertrade deals still make up only a small part of india s total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended december the sources said countertrade accounted for just five pct of india s billion dlrs in trade during fiscal ended march against almost nothing in official figures show however the figures exclude exchanges with the eastern bloc paid in non convertible indian rupees the sources said total trade with the soviet union involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for soviet arms and crude oil is estimated at billion dlrs in fiscal against three billion in indian countertrade which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country s large trade deficit is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by indonesia venezuela and brazil the trade sources said the trade deficit which hit an estimated record billion dlrs in is expected to decline to billion in the current fiscal year but the push to include non communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors including the slow growth of foreign reserves a tight debt repayment schedule shrinking aid and trade protectionism businessmen said one source said india is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past when the deals were made discreetly because they break gatt rules as a member of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt india cannot officially support bartering the mmtc s recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to yugoslavia for steel structures and rails mmtc s recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to india a trade official said adding that the policy remains flexible we also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to india the trade official said early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft ships drilling rigs and railway equipment to india that they stood a better chance if they bought indian goods or services in return the trade sources said illustrating the point the official said a south korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth mln dlrs to the state run oil and natural gas commission uk may revoke japanese financial licenses the british government may revoke the licences of selected japanese banks and securities companies operating in london s financial city when they come up for renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up japan s markets to foreign competition government sources said we can t say yes we are going to do it revoke licences but this is definitely being considered an official said his comments came after the government was formally urged today by a cross section of influential mps to take joint retaliatory action with the united states against japan britain has grown increasingly impatient with japanese trade practices there s a sense of urgency here now but the emphasis is on securing not undermining our interests in japan another government official told reuters prime minister margaret thatcher said on thursday that britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the financial services act and the banking bill to retaliate against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access she clearly had japan in mind government sources said the u k last year showed a trade defict with japan of billion stg official figures show a parliamentary motion signed by mps today urged the u k government to coordinate action with the president of the united states and through the department of trade and industry to suspend all further applications from japanese communications companies for equipment approval by the british approvals board for telecommunications and all further applications from japanese financial institutions for licences until authorities in japan stopped imposing what the mps called restrictive conditions on the bid by cable and wireless plc cawl l and its u s and japanese partners for a stake in japan s international telecommunications market the motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross section of mps reflecting the strength of feeling inside parliament parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on the conservative government to take firm action officials said another option now being considered by the u k is to refuse issuing new banking licences to japanese institutions that could be done under the government s proposed banking bill now moving through parliament japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal in london of which are banks in tokyo london based firms are authorised to do financial business officials said the new financial services and banking acts offer britain an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied under legally binding international trade agreements the financial services act gives trade and industry secretary paul channon power to stop firms from engaging in investment banking and insurance one official said this point has been made to the japanese at official level a number times the official added britain and france are now working together to urge that the european community take collective action against japan but by working within ec treaties another official said british trade minister alan clark said this week in a radio interview that the european community should build barriers against japanese imports through certification procedures similar to those facing european exporters in japan there comes a point where you cannot resist any longer he said adding such barriers can t be put in place overnight clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade strikes at the basis of whether british industry is to have a fair access to an extremely large market japan which is itself in a very dominant position in certain aspects of our own domestic market it is really a question of fairness the situation is only likely to worsen following news that japan s trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more than pct in february year on year to billion dlrs from billion in january political sources said but clark said in his interview that the issues of visible trade and access to financial markets should be kept separate should britain decide to act against japanese financial institutions it would most likely focus on the smaller rather than larger ones to minimise any risks to its role as a global business centre government sources said japan s four largest securities houses are members of the london stock exchange in washington white house officials said president reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the united states there was no immediate indication when reagan might act on the recommendations of his economic policy council to curb japanese exports to the united states but officials said the move could come today or early next week trade sources said the actions being weighed by reagan included tariffs on a wide variety of japanese exports which use semiconductors reagan ready to impose trade curbs against japan president reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the united states white house officials said there was no immediate indication when reagan might act on the recommendations of his economic policy council to curb japanese exports to the united states but officials said the move could come today or early next week trade sources said the actions being weighed by reagan include tariffs on a wide variety of japanese exports which use semiconductors the sources said the tariffs could be slapped on personal computers television receivers and laser printers with the aim of penalizing japan s major electronic firms including nec corp hitachi ltd toshiba corp and fujitsu ltd they said reaan could also delay invoking sanctions for a week or two giving japan a final opportunity to end the dumping practice but added that negotiators had already held extensive talks with the japanese to no avail japan s chip makers angered by u s sanction plans japanese computer chip makers reacted angrily to news the united states plans to take retaliatory action against them for allegedly failing to live up to an agreement on trade in computer microchips electronic industries association of japan eiaj chairman shoichi saba stated eiaj believes that it is premature and even irrational to attempt an assessment of the impact of the agreement and our efforts to comply with it only six months after concluding the agreement we urge u s governmental authorities to reconsider the decision made to evaluate fairly the results of japanese efforts in implementing the objectives of the agreement and to resist emotional biases he said yesterday washington announced plans to slap as much as mln dlrs in tariffs on japanese imports in retaliation for what is sees as japan s failure to comply with the terms of the pact the agreement struck late last year after months of heated negotiations called on japan to stop selling cut price chips on world markets and to buy more american made semiconductors to salvage the pact tokyo has instructed its chip makers to slash production and has helped establish a multi lateral organisation designed to promote chip imports saba said that japanese chip companies have pledged three mln dlrs over the next five years to the new organisation and expressed regret that no american company has seen fit to join this suggests that american semiconductor manufacturers may not be really interested in participating in the japanese market he said nakasone sounds conciliatory note in chip dispute prime minister yasuhiro nakasone sounded a conciliatory note in japan s increasingly bitter row with the united states over trade in computer microchips japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that need to be corrected he was quoted by kyodo news service as saying while expressing regret over america s decision to impose tariffs on imports of japanese electrical goods nakasone said tokyo was willing to send a high level official to washington to help settle the dispute government officials said japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after just days before the april deadline set by washington for the tariffs to take effect tokyo is expected to propose a joint u s japan investigation of american claims that japanese companies are dumping cut price chips in asian markets yesterday washington announced plans to put as much as mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain japanese electronic goods in retaliation for what it sees as tokyo s failure to live up to their bilateral chip pact that agreement hammered out late last year after months of heated negotiations called on japan to stop selling cut price chips in world markets and to buy more american made chips nakasone s comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory than those of his trade and industry minister hajime tamura who earlier today said japan was ready to take appropriate measures if washington went ahead with the sanctions ministry of international trade and industry miti officials later sought to downplay the significance of tamura s remark and said that his main message was that the two sides need to talk urgently about the issue but they admitted that japan was considering taking the united states to gatt the geneva based international organization which polices world trade if washington imposed the tariffs any japanese action would probably be taken under article of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt they said if that article were invoked gatt would set up a panel to consider the legality of the u s action but officials here said they hope that can be avoided it may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the united states may lift its decision at an early date tamura said in announcing the u s sanctions yesterday president ronald reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had evidence that japan was no longer dumping chips in world markets and had opened up its own market to imports japanese government officials said they are confident they can make the pact work they said that the export of cut price japanese chips through unregulated distributors has all but dried up after miti instructed domestic makers to cut output while acknowledging that it is harder to increase japanese imports of american chips miti officials said that the ministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens the ministry recently called on japan s major chip users some of whom are also leading producers to step up their purchases of foreign semiconductors a spokesman for one of the companies toshiba corp tsba t said his firm would do just that and could announce its plans in the next week or so he expects other japanese companies to do likewise islamic banks establish mln dlr trade portfolio the islamic development bank idb and islamic banks signed an agreement to establish a mln dlr trade portfolio to finance trade among islamic countries idb sources said they said idb s share in the portfolio which will only finance exports and imports of the private sector was limited to up to mln dlrs the sources said shares in the porfolio could be traded or redeemed by the idb adding that this was a major step in establishing an islamic financial market tokyo bids to stop chip row turning into trade war japan is seeking to prevent its computer chips dispute with the u s from erupting into a full scale trade war government officials said we hope that the dispute on this specific issue won t have an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the united states a ministry of international trade and industry miti official said on friday washington announced plans for as much as mln dlrs in tariffs on japanese electronic goods for tokyo s alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact that agreement reached last year after heated negotiations called on japan to stop selling cut price chips in world markets and to buy more american made semiconductors foreign ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from prime minister yasuhiro nakasone s planned trip to washington at the end of april while japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse american anger and ensure the trip s success they said the perception of japan in the u s congress is very bad one official told reuters we would very much like to do something to respond to that in an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas miti officials sought to depict the u s action as a severe warning to japanese semiconductor makers not to the government faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry american congress the japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute trade analysts said they said that it was an open secret that japan s largest chip maker nec corp was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures miti was taking to implement the pact included enforced production cuts the angry response of japanese chip makers yesterday to the announcement of the u s tariffs highlighted the difficulties the government faces in taking further action japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the u s japan agreement said shoichi saba chairman of the electronic industries association of japan he accused the u s of being irrational he said the u s action had made the bilateral chip pact meaningless saba s comments contrasted with those of prime minister yasuhiro nakasone who said tokyo wanted to solve the dispute through consultations japan is expected to send a high level official to washington early next month to try to convince the u s not to go ahead with the tariffs on april trade analysts say tokyo is likely to outline industry plans to step up purchases of u s chips and to propose a joint investigation into washington s allegations of chip dumping baldrige predicts end of u s japan trade dispute the united states and japan will soon settle their trade dispute over semiconductors u s commerce secretary malcolm baldrige said on television baldrige referring to the u s japan trade agreement on semiconductors said their government wants to live up to it their industries haven t been doing it and i think we ll have a good settlement to spare both sides i think the japanese understand full well that they haven t lived up to this commitment he said he added i do not think there will be a trade war at all on friday washington announced plans to put as much as mln dlrs in tariffs on japanese electronic goods from april because of tokyo s failure to observe the agreement the officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as japan started adhering to the agreement but they said there was little chance japan could react quickly enough to avert the higher tariffs baldrige said the reagan administration hoped the strong u s action against japan would convince congress to tone down protectionist trade legislation now being drafted he denied the action had been taken for that reason japan has little new to offer in microchip dispute the japanese government appears to have little new to offer to settle a dispute with the u s over computer chips trade analysts and government officials said the u s has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to mln dlrs on japanese electronics exports to the u s in retaliation for japan s alleged failure to keep a pact on the microchip trade signed last september a foreign ministry official told reuters japan has done what it can and now we must persuade the united states to wait for those steps to take effect the u s alleges that in defiance of the september agreement japan is still selling microchips at below cost in non u s markets and refusing to open japan further to u s chip sales u s tariffs are due to take effect on april analysts noted japan s ministry of international trade and industry miti has already ordered chipmakers to cut production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in third countries at non regulated prices i m not sure miti can do much more than it has said jardine fleming securities ltd analyst nick edwards a miti official said the ministry was not planning to call for production cuts beyond those already sought although it would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods spokesmen for some japanese electronics firms said they would consider buying more u s chips but a matsushita electric industrial co spokesman said a rapid increase in imports was not likely most analysts said japanese exporters would be hard hit if the united states did implement the tariffs which would be levied on consumer electronics products rather than on microchips themselves if the tariffs remain in place for any length of time there will be complete erosion of exports to the united states said tom murtha analyst at james capel and co the japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be stopped altogether but recovery for the industry will be delayed for another year he said some analysts said tariffs would also harm u s industry by stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in japan for semiconductors u s firms are trying to sell here the american approach is full of contradictions jardine fleming s edwards said if they want to expand u s exports the last thing they want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that hurts the final market edwards said but other analysts said the dispute reflects not just u s concern over what it sees as a strategic industry but also frustration with japan s vast trade surplus some analysts argued that to solve the semiconductor problem japan may have to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact carole ryavec an analyst at salomon brothers asia ltd said the major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic economy and move away from an export dependent economy nakasone sounds conciliatory note in chip dispute prime minister yasuhiro nakasone sounded a conciliatory note in japan s increasingly bitter row with the united states over trade in computer microchips japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that need to be corrected he was quoted by kyodo news service as saying while expressing regret over america s decision to impose tariffs on imports of japanese electrical goods nakasone said tokyo was willing to send a high level official to washington to help settle the dispute government officials said japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after just days before the april deadline set by washington for the tariffs to take effect tokyo is expected to propose a joint u s japan investigation of american claims that japanese companies are dumping cut price chips in asian markets on friday washington announced plans to put as much as mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain japanese electronic goods in retaliation for what it sees as tokyo s failure to live up to their bilateral chip pact tokyo bids to stop chip row becoming trade war japan is seeking to prevent its computer chips dispute with the u s from erupting into a full scale trade war government officials said we hope that the dispute on this specific issue won t have an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the united states a ministry of international trade and industry miti official said on friday washington announced plans for as much as mln dlrs in tariffs on japanese electronic goods for tokyo s alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact that agreement reached last year after heated negotiations called on japan to stop selling cut price chips in world markets and to buy more american made semiconductors foreign ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from prime minister yasuhiro nakasone s planned trip to washington at the end of april while japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse american anger and ensure the trip s success they said the perception of japan in the u s congress is very bad one official told reuters we would very much like to do something to respond to that in an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas miti officials sought to depict the u s action as a severe warning to japanese semiconductor makers not to the government faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry american congress the japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute trade analysts said they said that it was an open secret that japan s largest chip maker nec corp was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures miti was taking to implement the pact included enforced production cuts the angry response of japanese chip makers yesterday to the announcement of the u s tariffs highlighted the difficulties the government faces in taking further action japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the u s japan agreement said shoichi saba chairman of the electronic industries association of japan he accused the u s of being irrational he said the u s action had made the bilateral chip pact meaningless saba s comments contrasted with those of prime minister yasuhiro nakasone who said tokyo wanted to solve the dispute through consultations japan is expected to send a high level official to washington early next month to try to convince the u s not to go ahead with the tariffs on april trade analysts say tokyo is likely to outline industry plans to step up purchases of u s chips and to propose a joint investigation into u s allegations of chip dumping baldrige predicts end of u s japan trade dispute the united states and japan will soon settle their trade dispute over semiconductors u s commerce secretary malcolm baldrige said on television baldrige referring to the u s japan trade agreement on semiconductors said their government wants to live up to it their industries haven t been doing it and i think we ll have a good settlement to spare both sides i think the japanese understand full well that they haven t lived up to this commitment he said he added i do not think there will be a trade war at all on friday washington announced plans to put as much as mln dlrs in tariffs on japanese electronic goods from april because of tokyo s failure to observe the agreement the officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as japan started adhering to the agreement but they said there was little chance japan could react quickly enough to avert the higher tariffs baldrige said the reagan administration hoped the strong u s action against japan would convince congress to tone down protectionist trade legislation now being drafted he denied the action had been taken for that reason yugoslav trade falls sharply statistics show yugoslav trade is declining rapidly this year in hard currency terms according to the latest federal statistics office fso figures the fso figures showed total exports from january to march valued at

worldwide trade surplus the symbol of the u s trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around america s record trade deficit japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade the challenge to our high technology industries the threat of government nutured competition and the multitude of barriers to our exports senate democratic leader robert byrd said if we can find a way to come to terms with japan over trade problems we can manage our difficulties with other countries the west virginia democrat said at a senate finance committee hearing on the trade bill byrd and house speaker jim wright a texas democrat have made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide ranging bill is being readied for probable house approval next month japan s bilateral trade surplus jumped from billion dlrs in to billion dlrs last year its surplus rose to billion dlrs in february from billion dlrs in january congress points to the record billion dlrs u s trade deficit in and the slow response in the trade imbalance to the dollar s decline in world currency markets as a reason to press japan to buy more u s goods they are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration in u s exports of sophisticated computer technology in response to the growing anger and pressure by the u s semiconductor industry president reagan friday announced he intended to raise tariffs as much as mln dlrs on japanese electronic goods in retaliation for japan s failure to abide by a u s japanese semiconductor agreement congress also has been been angered by the administration s lack of success with japan on a host of other trade issues including beef citrus automobile parts telecommunications goods and financial services the bulk of the house trade bill was written last week in four committees it is a package of trade sanctions and measures to force the administration take tough action against foreign trade barriers and unfair competition although most provisions do not single out japan in many cases their impact would be to restrict imports of japanese products or make them more expensive with higher duties the cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the house ways and means committee by a vote of to its focus is to force president reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign competition and to make it easier for u s industries to win temporary relief from surges in imports the most controversial issue an amendment to restrict imports if countries such as japan with large surpluses do not buy more u s goods was left for an april vote by the house rep richard gephardt a democratic presidential aspirant from missouri has the support of wright and other key democrats to press for passage of the amendment the measure would have the most impact on japan west germany taiwan and south korea if japan for example does not reduce its barriers by mid the united states would set import quotas or tariffs to cut japanese surplus by ten per cent a year for three years i m tired of going into companies and having managers say to me we re not over competing in japan because we can t compete in the marketplace that argument needs to be taken away from american business gephardt said the administration has said it could not support a trade bill containing such a provision u s trade official says japan action foolish a high level u s trade official said it would be foolish for japan to strike back against the united states for its sanctions on japanese semiconductor electronics products asked by reporters if japan was expected to retaliate against u s exports deputy under secretary of commerce bruce smart replied that would be the height of foolishness in addition he doubted japan could show enough progress in meeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actual imposition of the mln dlrs in tariffs on april japan s billion dlr trade surplus with the united states last year has come under fire in congress concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the record billion dlrs u s trade deficit in president reagan s sanctions decision won praise today from the two democratic leaders of congress i think it s about time senate democratic leader robert byrd of west virginia told reporters house speaker jim wright of texas told reporters before the opening of the house session it just shows we were right all along when we said something needs doing smart testified before a senate labor committee hearing that last friday s u s trade action would help u s negotiations on access to japan for u s auto parts since last august smart has been leading talks to open up japan to purchases of more u s made automotive parts last year japan racked up a billion dlr trade surplus with the united states in these products both countries expect to conclude the talks by august it s amazing to me that the japanese were surprised i hope it will persuade them we re serious smart said of the white house trade sanctions the united states has tried to convince japanese car companies of the quality of american made parts and to draw them away from their traditional japanese suppliers all we ask is a chance we have a job to do persuading them we can do better than our reputation seems to be he said measured per car each american made car contained about dlrs in japanese auto parts while each japanese made car contained about dlrs in u s auto parts smart said european community to set up office in peking china and the european community ec signed an agreement on the establishment of an ec office here chinese vice foreign minister zhou nan and the ec s external relations commissioner willy de clercq signed the accord ec sources said the office was likely to open in the second half of this year in the ec was china s third largest trading partner with chinese imports from the ec worth billion dlrs and exports worth billion dlrs de clercq told the official china daily that more joint ventures should be set up in china as a way of reducing china s trade deficit with the ec the ec s affairs in china are currently looked after by whichever country holds the group s six monthly rotating presidency now held by the belgians until the danes take over in july trade friction threatens to topple nakasone prime minister yasuhiro nakasone may have been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen s renewed rapid rise and the threat of a trade war with the united states political analysts said nakasone already under fire over an unpopular tax reform plan may now be forced to resign before the june economic summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later next month go against candidates from his ruling liberal democratic party ldp they said the close relationship between nakasone and president reagan was an important element of nakasone s power base waseda university political science professor mitsuru uchida told reuters so the emergence of u s criticism damages nakasone even before the latest trade friction flared nakasone was encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but also within his own ldp over his proposal to levy a sales tax many factions within the ldp are distancing themselves from nakasone uchida said his position within the ldp itself is not so strongly established today nakasone who has been more popular with the general public than with many ldp members is now seeing his public support eroded the analysts said the yen s rise to record highs and the u s threat on friday to impose tariffs on japanese electronics goods in retaliation for japan s alleged violation of a microchip trade pact are now giving nakasone s critics fresh ammunition the analysts said apparently the special relationship between reagan and nakasone hasn t worked effectively rei shiratori director of the institute for political studies in japan said this is making the japanese people doubt nakasone s credibility shiratori told reuters the cumulative impact of the sales tax issue the yen s rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious ldp losses in the april and local elections analysts said if the elections go against the ldp nakasone may have to resign early shiratori said but nakasone still has a chance to soothe u s tempers before or during his week long washington visit from april some analysts said however unless the japanese political system can move more quickly to give nakasone some nice present to take to washington on smouldering trade issues he will face a very hostile audience said merrill lynch securities economist william sterling if the trip is a major disaster it would seem to put the final nail in his coffin he said reagan s own weakened domestic position and growing republican as well as democratic anger with japan argue against a quick settlement to the trade dispute the analysts said but a desire on both sides to find some solution coupled with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to nakasone could still lead to an attempt to paper over the differences and aid nakasone they said one factor against a trade war may be that washington is not anxious to push nakasone into his grave sterling said europe on sidelines in u s japan microchip row rising imports of japanese made cars and electronic goods may upset west european officials but they generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest trade row between the united states and japan japan s huge trade surplus is a sore point in west europe as it is in the united states but u s charges of unfair trade practices involving computer microchips leave europeans cold the european community ran a billion dlr trade deficit with japan last year and seeks redress when it feels japanese trade policy hurts europeans diplomats and economists said but only in britain has there been any suggestion of acting with the u s to do something about japan s huge trade surplus the ec is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the u s said martin wolf director of studies at the trade policy research centre in london basically their policies are pretty much the same but that did not mean europe would support the u s or that the ec would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of the u s dispute to press its own claims wolf said basically europeans have a different approach to trade problems he said in the u s people talk about fair trade but not here he added in the u s it all has to do with the general ethic of free competition while in europe the general approach is that liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich wolf said this basic u s attitude explains washington s tendency to impose so called countervailing duties an import tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair in western europe the approach to trade disputes tends to be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation wolf said in the latest u s japan trade row president reagan has threatened to raise tariffs on selected japanese electronic goods by as much as mln dlrs alleging that japan has failed to abide by a u s japan pact on microchip trade but the european community has challenged the agreement as a violation of general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt practices that discriminates against its microchip producers it follows that they re not likely to rally to the side of the united states in defence of the agreement said wolf although british parliamentarians are pushing for a tough line on japanese trade issues government officials in the rest of europe told reuter correspondents they would let the ec take the lead in any response to the u s japan trade row a spokeswoman for the ec commission in brussels told reuters there has been no change in the community s position since a march meeting of foreign ministers which sent a strong warning to tokyo on trade imbalances in a statement issued after that meeting ec foreign ministers deplored japan s continued trade imbalance and appealed for a greater japanese effort to open up its markets ec external trade commissioner willy de clercq said after the talks there was a growing impatience with japan in the ec diplomats accredited to the ec in brussels said they saw no signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad ranging sanctions against japan the ec is anxious to avoid provoking a trade war they said instead the community is trying to target problem areas in european trade with japan including wines and spirits cosmetics and financial services and will continue talking to try to improve the situation the diplomats said in britain where the government is angered over the difficulties telecommunications giant cable and wireless has faced in its bid to crack the japanese market officials said last week that retaliatory action is being considered but government officials said last night we are not talking about days or weeks this is going to take time they said the government would consider its options at a cabinet meeting on thursday but added that no final decisions were expected the main thing the british would threaten the japan with is denial of access to london s booming financial markets government officials said thatcher says trade targets set with moscow british prime minister margaret thatcher said she and soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov had set targets for increased trade between the two countries during talks earlier today she said she hoped more economic exchanges between britain and the soviet union will also lead to increased friendship and increased understanding earlier she told a meeting of soviet and british businessmen that she had agreed with ryzhkov that they would work to achieve a total volume of billion roubles in bilateral trade by this would entail an increase by each side of to mln stg over their present export levels mr ryzhkov handed me a list of import and export opportunities which i hope you will all jump at she told the meeting to mark the opening of new offices of the british soviet chamber of commerce after her talks with ryzhkov thatcher and the soviet premier were joined for the signing of

domestic semiconductor makers will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips from next month in line with government attempts to ward off u s trade sanctions company spokesmen said the moves might persuade the u s to call off the sanctions despite obstacles to full implementation of the plans analysts said the tariffs will affect about mln dlrs worth of products and are in retaliation for japan s alleged failure to honour a semiconductor trade pact in announcing the sanctions last friday president reagan said japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory pricing and open japan s market to foreign products but u s trade representative clayton yeutter said yesterday on u s television that the u s is willing to drop the tariffs if japan shows a clear indication that it will open its markets to u s goods the ministry of international trade and industry miti has urged producers to slash output of the chips by pct in the second quarter following a call to reduce production by more than pct the previous quarter miti also urged makers to boost chip imports analysts said the moves could encourage washington to cancel the tariffs ahead of next month s meeting between prime minister yasuhiro nakasone and president reagan the u s wants to be satisfied it has rattled its sword and shown that it can and will do business said analyst nick edwards at jardine fleming securities ltd in tokyo but analysts cautioned that although japanese producers can cut output boosting imports the key to u s withdrawal of the sanctions is more difficult the u s does not have the low end consumer ic s integrated circuits that the japanese need for consumer products they re well supplied here said richard may senior analyst at barclays de zoete wedd ltd in tokyo the u s leads in production of medium and high end ic s but japanese makers are keen to develop their own high end production skills the analysts said the japanese must be prepared to trade some

said the meeting was unveiled as part of a plan to boost imports and help head off protectionist legislation in the u s senior officials from the ministry of international trade and industry told reporters that such personal appeals appeared to have paid off in the past as japanese imports of manufactured goods have climbed leading domestic semiconductor makers will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips next month in an attempt to help ward off u s trade sanctions company spokesmen said the officials also said they expect the government s new trade insurance law to boost imports and encourage japanese companies to set up production facilities overseas under the new law the government will insure japanese companies who pre pay for imports against loss arising

on japan and the united states to ensure that we do avoid such a trade war asked whether he believed such a trade war could be averted lawson replied i very much hope so britain last week warned that it would retaliate if japan did not move soon to open its markets to outside competition prime minister margaret thatcher gave notice that the u k would fight the japanese government s attempt to

earlier soviet union seen watching china gatt application china s application to join the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt is seen as a test case by the soviet union which will probably demand to follow china a top european community official said willy de clercq external relations commissioner of the european communities told a news conference that china s application would involve long and difficult negotiations china formally applied to join gatt in july and in february presented a memorandum backing its application which de clercq said was now being studied questions would then be presented to china after china other important state trading countries including the soviet union will probably demand accession china s application could be considered a test case he said he said the ec strongly backed china s application but others among gatt s contracting parties took a tougher line among the numerous problems of a huge centrally run economy entering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity and the expectation that china will practice an open trade policy without trade discrimination de clercq added de clercq noted the different dimensions of the chinese economy and those of hungary and yugoslavia the two current socialist gatt members on china s import potential he said a foreign exchange shortage would force china to import less this year and next than in the past with an emphasis on technological equipment and capital during his visit de clercq has met top chinese leaders and today signed an agreement to open a european community commission office in peking u s senate leaders see no trade war brewing the senate s democratic and republican leaders praised president reagan for retaliating against japan for violating a semiconducter accord but dashed cold water on ideas it was the first shot in a trade war senate democratic leader robert byrd and republican leader bob dole both told the senate reagan s decision was long overdue and urged japan to open its markets to u s goods and stop dumping on world markets each noted in separate speeches that they saw no trade war over the issue despite concerns in financial markets that fear has no basis in fact byrd said yeutter says stock market overreacted to japan trade dispute u s stock market overreacts to tariffs yeutter u s trade representative clayton yeutter said the stock market overreacted to a u s decision last week to proceed with tariffs on some japanese computer products speaking to reporters prior to testifying at a house agriculture committee hearing yeutter said it is difficult to comprehend that a trade decision affecting only mln dlrs in goods caused the stock market collapse yesterday i have a hunch a lot of other things were involved in that stock market fall including simple profit taking yeutter said yeutter said japan would be sending a senior official from its trade ministry to washington next week for talks on the computer chip dispute we will be glad to have him here but that s not going to affect a decision that s already been made yeutter said the decision announced last week would apply higher tariffs on a range of japanese products in retaliation for the alleged failure of tokyo to honor an agreement with the u s on semiconductor trade envoy advises nakasone to prepare for u s visit the japanese ambassador to the u s suggested that prime minister yasuhiro nakasone make efforts to present advanced proposals on trade issues when he visits washington next month ambassador nobuo matsunaga made the recommendation at a meeting with nakasone kyodo news service said matsunaga also advised that the prime minister should be prepared to discuss u s japan economic issues matsunaga cited issues such as a u s japan micro chip trade pact foreign access to the kansai international airport project and a new international telecommunications firm matsunaga returned on sunday to report to japanese leaders on recent u s developments over trade in preparation for nakasone s visit to washington april to may kyodo quoted nakasone as telling reporters after meeting the envoy i entirely accept what ambassador matsunaga recommended nakasone did not elaborate the u s japan trade dispute intensified last week when president ronald reagan said the u s would impose heavy tariffs on japanese imports in retaliation against alleged japanese breach of the computer chip trade pact meanwhile nakasone s ruling liberal democratic party ldp is to consider measures to boost imports and open up the japanese market such as government purchase of supercomputers and expanding foreign access to the kansai airport project party sources said the ldp international economic affairs council was responding to nakasone s request for measures to reduce japan s increasing trade surpluses with the u s and europe they said treasury s baker sees billion dlr u s trade deficit reduction this year treasury s baker sees smaller trade deficit treasury secretary james baker predicted the u s trade deficit would decline billion dlrs this year however he acknowledged signs were still lacking on such a decline we think we are beginning to see changes he told the house appropriations committee it has begun to level off but we don t see it beginning to go down yet he told the panel treasury s baker not concerned by bond declines treasury secretary james baker asked whether he was concerned about yesterdays precipitous decline in bond prices said he was not questioned by reporters as he left a house committee hearing baker said no when asked about the bond decline adding that it was a reflection of concern about the possibility of a trade war it is what the markets think would be the adverse consequences of a trade war he said the administration was concerned that protectionism would lead to international trade problems adding that he thought the action against the japanese was still consistent with this policy u s japan not in trade war yeutter says the united states and japan are not involved in a trade war despite u s sanctions announced last week against japanese semiconductors u s trade representative clayton yeutter said in my judgement we re not even close to a trade war yeutter told a house agriculture committee hearing yeutter said if japan takes action to honor its agreement with the u s on semiconductor trade then the retaliatory response will last a relatively short period yeutter said japan must stop dumping chips in third countries and buy more american computer chips chirac reagan discuss arms control trade french prime minister jacques chirac opened talks with president ronald reagan expected to focus on superpower arms control moves and trade issues french officials said a major aim of chirac s visit was to present france s concern that the united states might ignore european security interests in any accord with moscow on removing medium range nuclear missiles from the continent but reagan was expected to assure chirac that he will not agree to a deal at the geneva superpower talks that would give the russians superiority in shorter range systems diplomats said france has expressed doubts about removing u s missiles from europe so long as the soviet union maintains an edge in other weaponry particularly shorter range rockets conventional forces and chemical weapons speaking last night chirac set out the french position saying any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should mention how equality can be achieved in short range missiles reagan and chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a dispute between two leading research institutes over patent rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease aids in a joint statement chirac and reagan said the pasteur institute in paris and the national cancer institute of bethesda maryland agreed to give part of the royalties from the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight against aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome this agreement opens a new era in franco american cooperation allowing france and the united states to join their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of speeding the development of an aids vaccine and cure reagan said at the signing ceremony he said the two parties would share the patent and give per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation the foundation would also raise private funds and would donate per cent of its money to combat aids in less developed countries both leaders stressed the long ties between france and the united states during a welcoming ceremony in the white house east room with reagan describing france as america s oldest ally in war and peace i have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by the same ideals of freedom by the same will to face the dangers which we both confront terrorism war hunger poverty new diseases and drugs chirac replied but the two countries are likely to have less to agree on over the issue of trade where chirac is worried about a rise in protectionism in the u s congress a senior u s official yesterday dismissed a french idea to sell cut price grain to poor countries in africa as a way of lessening surplus stocks chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea first proposed by french agriculture minister francois guillaume during his two day visit to washington the u s official described the idea as a grain producers opec a reference to the organization of petroleum exporting countries and said it went against the reagan administration s desire to lessen government intervention in trade reagan renews anti protectionism stand white house says trade war unlikely trade war fears may prompt stock markets downturn the threatened trade war between the united states and japan is just the kind of shock that economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin but they are not so sure if that would be a brief corrective dip or whether this week s falling share prices mark the start of a bear market it s the billion dollar question said richard o brien economist at american express international bank in london japan s trade surplus billion dlrs last year has poured into share and bond markets around the world and funded a good chunk of the huge u s budget deficit around a third of any new sale of u s treasury bonds has been bought by the japanese however japanese investors have lost money as the dollar falls and will lose more if the united states lets it fall further to cut the trade deficit the counterpart of improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or because the u s increases duties on japanese electronic goods may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget deficit and if the u s trade deficit does fall the japanese will have less money to invest to entice u s investors to fill the gap that would be left if the japanese stopped buying u s bonds interest rates would have to soar o brien said the subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls on the world stock markets a year ago we could be pretty confident about the markets said o brien now it is much less certain buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming economy but the world economy with sluggish growth at best in the industrial nations a massive load of third world debt and huge trade imbalances is not in good shape said o brien nevertheless new york analyst william raferty of smith barney harris upham said we re still in a bull market adding that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and the bear usually strikes slowly economist evelyn brody at morgan grenfell and co in london said the huge sums of money going through the world financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices although interest by the japanese in putting their money in non dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it s very difficult to see where else they can put their money than in u s dollars and especially the u s treasury bond market according to david butcher a senior executive at yamaichi securities co ltd s bond operation in london he said the japanese are paying much closer attention now to the french franc and west german mark in the longer run he worries about what trade tensions and the dollar s slide will mean for securities markets white house discounts threat of trade war president reagan has reaffirmed his opposition to protectionism and his chief spokesman said trade sanctions imposed on japan were unlikely to start a trade war we don t want to go down that road reagan was quoted as telling prime minister jacques chirac after the visiting french official expressed concern about the rising tide of protectionist sentiment in the united states later white house spokesman marlin fitzwater defended the new sanctions against japan and said administration officials do not believe this will result in a trade war it is the first time that the united states has taken an action of this type and it is significant but it is nothing to be alarmed about the presidential spokesman added we do not want protectionism we do not want a trade war he said fitzwater said the president was forced to act in the japanese microchip case because tokyo had failed to fulfill an agreement to make some corrections noting that there are enormous pressures in the congress and the land for the united states to take a tough stand he said this was a case where we felt we simply had to act fitzwater said the decision to impose sanctions was well considered by this administration and not taken lightly while the white house official held open the possibility that washington and tokyo will settle their trade dispute he indicated a settlement probably would not come in time to head off the sanctions we are always open to negotations whether it a settlement could occur in time to prevent this the sanctions from going into effect is questionable at this point the spokesman said the sanctions take effect in mid april baldrige says u s to go ahead with japanese sanctions baldrige says u s to impose japanese sanctions commerce secretary malcolm baldrige said the united states would go ahead with planned mln dlr sanctions against japanese semiconductor exports despite any u s japanese talks to avert the trade curbs he said in a speech to an export import group that he was sure the united states and japan could work out their dispute over unfair japanese trade practices in semiconductor trade but i am sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out sanctions are to be imposed on april he also said he did not think there would be a trade war with japan because japan had too much value in exports to the united states to risk such a war those fears are unfounded he said he told reporters later that the sharp drop in the securities market was not due to fears of a trade war but fear of inflation and that the federal reserve may act on that fact market reaction was also due he said to the drop in the value of the dollar although trade issues did have some effect baldrige said that observers who were attributing the drop in the market to trade sanctions were barking up the wrong tree he said the market observers will realize this shortly baldrige said his remarks did not mean to suggest anything about the market or the exchange rate of the dollar senior u s official to visit japan as trade row grows undersecretary of state michael armacost will visit tokyo next week for meetings with

tomorrow to a pending trade bill increasing funding for the export enhancement program eep and significantly expanding the scope of the program at a press conference republican lawmakers said they would propose expanding eep to include all countries willing to purchase additional commodities at reasonable prices in addition the congressmen said they would propose extending the life of eep to five years from the current three years and increasing the eep funding ceiling to billion dlrs from billion at present the agriculture committee tomorrow will begin drafting amendments to an omnibus trade bill now before the house responding to the republican plan agriculture secretary richard lyng and trade representative clayton yeutter said they favor a flexible targeted use of eep instead of an across the board program which they termed too costly the republican congressmen also said they will offer an amendment to the trade bill instructing the u s agriculture department to value the bonus commodities used for eep at the market value rather than the cost of acquisition but lyng said usda already plans to change to market value accounting rather than acquisition value in order to avoid hitting a funding ceiling for eep of billion dlrs lyng said under market value accounting only about mln dlrs of eep commodities have been used to date using acquisition value usda officials

anti u s feeling here another miti official said a senior foreign ministry official who declined to be identified told reuters the u s threats have undercut those in the government who argue for conciliation there is a very strong argument in japan that since the united states is imposing tariffs unilaterally why should we bother doing anything he said anything we do we will be bashed the senior official sounded pessimistic about the likelihood of prime minister yasuhiro nakasone defusing u s anger over japanese trade practices when he visits washington on april i don t think trade

and trade confrontations finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss a deteriorating global debt and economic situation the meetings under the auspices of the international monetary fund and world bank come as interest rates are turning higher and the already weak dollar has sunk further upsetting bond and stock markets uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global economy and whether the heavily indebted countries can continue to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new assistance monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs any new debt initiative of the sort that treasury secretary james baker unveiled months ago in seoul is in the works the strategy has drawn a serious challenge from brazil which suspended interest payments on billion dlrs of commercial bank debt last month the banks have responded by laying the groundwork for writing down brazilian loans separately french prime minister jacques chirac in a visit earlier this week with president reagan sounded out the administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to the very poorest states the french plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers in detail during next week s meetings and will undoubtedly be embraced by the developing countries there s interest on the part of some countries for looking at the support of the special problems of the very poorest countries because their position is so extreme a reagan administration official said he suggested washington was open to disussing the issue the meetings will also assess the success of the baker debt initiative which called for new funding to help debtor countries grow out of their problems the largest industrial countries have been attempting to coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the decline of the dollar u s trade and budget deficits and other problems at the same time the industrial countries see little evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the fund forecasts they will grow pct the united states sees pct growth for itself continuing its expansion for a fifth year and has asked other industrial countries to stimulate their economies these issues directly affect the debt problem and the ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their difficulties in recent years u s markets have absorbed the exports of developing country allowing them to earn critical foreign exchange but the united states wants to cut its trade deficit running at a record billion dlrs and is pressing others to import more from developing countries the discussions from april six to will be wide ranging touching everything from interest rates to the impact of development loans on the environment according to monetary sources the talks will include an examination of trade protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the reagan administration to place some mln dlrs in tariffs on microchip products from japan the sources said the move accelerated the dollar s decline as financial markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing there is concern that the action prompted by u s charges that japan has been selling computer chip products below fair market value and has kept its own market closed to imports further undermining the international trading system at the same time the ministers will discuss the fundamental price weakness in basic commodities the export mainstay of many developing countries the so called group of five industrial countries the united states japan west germany france and britain will gather for the first time since their february talks in paris where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further the five will be joined later by italy and canada for further debate on economic policy coordination as part of the paris accord surplus countries such as japan agreed to stimulate their economies while america said it would reduce its federal budget deficit other major issues of the meetings include a u s bid to to have a larger say in approving loans of the inter american development bank strengthening the link between loans and economic policy changes in debtor nations washington is also pressing the world bank to take more account of the environment when making loan for dams and other projects the new head of the bank barber conable has said this issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization plan for the bank now being prepared u s japanese open talks on semiconductors u s and japanese officials meet tomorrow to try to settle a dispute over semiconductor trade and to cut short the mln dlr penalty tariffs president reagan has ordered imposed on japanese exports but u s officials held out little hope that any accord could be reached before the tariffs of per cent up from about five per cent are to take effect on april the customs bureau last week started to levy a bond on the japanese goods that reagan ordered penalized the penalties would be retroactive to march reagan said on march when ordering the tariffs that he hoped the japanese would soon end their unfair practices in semiconductor trade and that sanctions could be lifted technical meetings are to be held today and tomorrow with meetings at a more senior level scheduled for thursday and friday public hearings on the sanctions are set for april the japanese aides here for the technical talks include shigeru muraoka director general of international trade policy of the ministry of international trade and industry miti and masashi yamamoto deputy director general of the information and machinery bureau meeting with them will glen fukushima director of the japan office of the u s trade representative s office and jim gradoville of trade representative s office of industry and services the two sides in the thursday and friday talks will be headed by deputy u s trade representative michael smith and miti vice minister makoto kuroda uk minister looks to ease tension with japan the u k government hopes for a breakthrough on the deadlock with japan over trade policies during next week s visit to tokyo by corporate affairs minister michael howard political sources said howard who leaves for japan tomorrow told reuters he will try to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit meanwhile britain will re examine a letter from japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone promising personal help in solving the row over a u k firm s bid to win a significant role in japan s telecommunications market government sources said tensions have risen following britain s decision to arm itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be used against certain japanese financial institutions britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from nakasone to prime minister margaret thatcher seeing it as a signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the bid launched by cable and wireless plc government officials said but this view has since been clouded by reports from tokyo that nakasone s assurances really constituted little more than politeness in the face of british anger they added conable warns protectionism might spread world bank president barber conable expressed concern that trade protectionism at the heart of a new showdown between the united states and japan might spread throughout the industrial world but in an interview with reuters conable said the action by the united states to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full scale trade war conable said the world bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth we have in fact been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world doesn t close at the same time he said he said the u s action against japan was a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy the interview came just before next week s semi annual meetings of the bank and the international monetary fund referring to brazil s recent interest payments moratorium conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched he said the bank which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams roads and sewers will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform the bank has increased these loans in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets encouraging foreign investment and reducing government s role in the economy we re comfortable with adjustment lending we expect however that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio conable said he made clear however that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall bank lending for some time he noted the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt conable is a a former republican congressman from new york chosen by president reagan for the bank position last year he is an associate of treasury secertary james baker who launched the u s strategy for shoring up indebted nations in october which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the world bank conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the bank s organization to be completed in the next several weeks he said the decision to seek a reorganization was based in part on the fact that the bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency the reorganization is considered a major initiative by conable and is being closely watched by the agency s member countries as an indication of his management style and priorities i want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow conable said however he said i don t believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and i don t believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose he said however that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by baker has given the bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis conable added that cooperation between the bank and its sister agency the international monetary fund was good and that he talked often with imf managing director michel camdessus on a variety of issues on a personal level conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the bank noting that i don t have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development he added so i don t feel a great calling to personalize the institution on the development needs of sub sahara africa conable said that the bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region noting that half of the recently agreed financing of billion dlrs for bank s international development association was earmarked for africa leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations like those in the sub sahara during next week s meetings taiwan trade surplus widens in first quarter taiwan s trade surplus widened to billion u s dlrs in the first quarter of from billion a year ago the government statistics department said first quarter exports rose to billion u s dlrs from billion in the same period in imports rose to billion from billion last year the march trade surplus was billion dlrs compared with billion in february and billion in march exports rose to billion u s dlrs from billion in february and billion in march last year imports were billion dlrs against billion in february and billion in march britain warns japan over trade row british corporate affairs minister michael howard told japan to resolve the row over the u k firm cable and wireless plc s cawl l shareholding in a new japanese telecommunications company or face an abrupt deterioration in trade relations in meetings with both the foreign and telecommunications ministers howard said he expressed deep concern about the way tokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing trade imbalance between the two countries i put it to the post and telecommunications minister that i was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abrupt deterioration in the trading relations of our countries which would have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world howard told reporters he listened very carefully and i have little doubt the message got home he added british frustration over the lopsided trade balance nearly six billion dlrs in japan s favour last year has reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue howard said howard has accused japan of trying to shut out cable and wireless from having a major role in the international telephone market in japan i want a fair crack of the whip for cable and wireless as i want a fair crack of the whip for britain generally in trading relations howard said we simply aren t prepared to continue to accept the imbalance which has been the position for such a long time post and telecommunications ministry officials were unable to comment on howard s meeting with their minister but foreign ministry officials said foreign minister tadashi kuranari said that british exports to japan are increasing but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications dispute including cable and wireless to be satisfied howard told reporters that britain was actively considering possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the telecommunications issue there are measures which are under consideration if we continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations he added but gave no details he said he had received a reassuring response from the japanese he has spoken with but of course we ve had reassuring signs from the japanese for quite some time he added what i ve made plain is we expect to see action howard ruled out using powers in britain s financial services bill to retaliate against unfair trade practices those powers which allow london to ban foreign financial firms like banks from britain are designed to ensure u k firms equal access to overseas financial markets volcker says exchange rate adjustment enough to narrow u s trade deficit volcker says reducing u s budget deficit needed to improve trade balance volcker says more stimulus abroad needed for adjustments in trade balances volcker urges industrial nations to keep trade markets open to foster growth u s calls for greater gatt checks on trade the united states has appealed for stronger powers for the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt to enforce world trade rules the call by u s deputy trade representative michael smith at a special committee meeting into the future of gatt follows a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by the nation body to promote fair trade today s meeting was part of the uruguay trade round launched by ministers last september the round which covers areas of trade in agriculture manufactured goods and services will take four years to negotiate smith called for boosting gatt s links with financial institutions such as the international monetary fund and world bank he also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to ensure the success of the uruguay round the gatt as an institution needs to be strengthened to assure that the gatt plays its proper role in management of the world trading system and the global economy smith said rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy he also also urged that member states be accountable to each other for their trade policies smith who flies to brussels today for talks with european community ec officials told reuters the committee wanted to stress gatt s importance and did not discuss specifics we are interested in more periodic ministerial involvement whether in formal or informal meetings he said gatt s ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the nation ec on april about the u s japanese accord on semiconductors the ec charges the accord breached gatt trade rules by allowing tokyo to set minimum prices for japanese chips sold in third countries and is requesting a gatt dispute panel be set up to review the agreement president reagan who strongly supported the uruguay trade round to promote freer trade has said washington will impose tariffs against japanese electronic goods he said tokyo had not shown willingness to open its markets to u s exports volcker urges quick aid to debtor nations federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said that debtor nations have made much progress in laying the groundwork for economic growth but a solution to world debt difficulties was endangered by inaction on new financing there is clearly a danger that adequate financing arrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in a timely way volcker told the senate banking committee the borrowing countries need to be able to proceed with confidence that the necessary funds will be available to them he said brazil has the potential for becoming a leading world economic power but it is in a difficult position today volcker said he said it will take a concerted effort to regularize brazil s external payments the key prerequisite is clearly in the hands of brazilian authorities he said both brazil and its creditors have a strong incentive to work together volcker said regarding trade imbalances volcker said that it was critically important that markets be kept open by the industrial nations in addition the united states must reduce its budget deficit and foreign nations need to provide stimulus to their domestic economies volcker said we need time for those actions and the earlier depreciation to work their effects he said volcker pushes spending cuts over trade bill federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said reducing the federal budget deficit was a more important goal for congress than drafting trade legislation reduce the budget deficit volcker responded when asked by a member of the senate banking committee about trade legislation priorities if you don t deal with the budget deficit everything else you do is going to be counterproductive he said japan cuts chip supply may produce shortage japan is attempting to cut back semiconductor production to forstall the mln dlrs in u s tariffs on japanese electronic goods set to take effect april industry analysts said the move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks the analysts said prices have gone up for memory components the mainstay of the japanese semiconductor industry analyst drew peck of donaldson lufkin and jenrette said but analysts said the price rises have been slight so far and some questioned whether japan would be successful in forcing japanese companies to cut production in the long run others however were more optimistic saying evidence was already in hand that japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs we ve seen the grey market begin to dry up for d rams and it has virtually dried up for eproms said merrill lynch analyst thomas kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching kurlack added industry analysts said japan s ministry of international trade and industry or miti had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year s semiconductor accord with the u s the reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on japanese electronic goods alleging that japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the u s market but some analysts said japan s attempt to mollify the u s was a double edged sword and might be read at a subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the u s as production in japan is cut these analysts argue prices will rise in the u s and few american semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips u s computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured the japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from washington but at the same time they re demonstating their muscle analyst peck said the cut backs in japanese production are expected to benefit u s chip makers i think this could be a very important factor for u s semiconductor manufacturers industry analyst elliot levine of ladenburg thalmann co said but analyst peck said it will take a few weeks to see whether japan has genuinely cut production he said japanese manufactures were likely to view miti s request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write offs in plant and equipment u s urges surplus nations to boost growth leading industrial nations will be reviewing the paris agreement to stabilize exchange rates foster increased worldwide growth and reduce trade imbalances but the u s thinks the accord has been successful so far a senior u s treasury official said the paris accord will be reviewed at this meeting it has been successful and continues to be succesfull a senior u s treasury official told reporters in a briefing ahead of this week s semiannual imf and world bank meetings he also said the u s was looking to west germany and japan to bolster their economic growth the official said both surplus countries like west germany and japan and deficit countries like the u s agreed to play a role in bringing about more balanced economic growth he reaffirmed the u s would press ahead with efforts to reduce its budget deficit resist protectionism and boost u s competitiveness the official also said that he expected trade issues like the dispute between the u s and japan over microchips to be included in the discussions the official made no direct comment on the content or schedule of forthcoming group of five and group of seven discussions he said that industrial countries are concerned that the large external imbalances remain a threat to the international monetary system he added that the meetings will also provide an opportunity to discuss economic policy coordination efforts the official said indicators would be used to measure policy objectives of industrial countries and their economic projections they would also be used to assess progress of policy goals asked whether the u s was proposing a new initiative regarding the indicators the official said the issue would be reported to the venice summit in june monetary sources said the u s proposal envisages using the indicators to make policy coordination agreements like the paris accord more binding canadians urge exemption from u s trade bill a group of canadian lawmakers from ontario today asked their u s counterparts to exempt canada from the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major trade bill being considered by the u s congress at a meeting of the northeast midwest coalition an organization of u s legislators david cooke chairman of the ontario parliament s select committee on economic affairs said the exemption would help trade relations the trade legislation to be considered by the full house in late april would require president reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would harm the u s economy currently reagan can reject trade sanctions on any grounds cooke a member of the liberal party told the u s congressmen i can understand the trade bill i think it has to do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world i would suggest to you that we are your best friends you do not have those concerns with canada and you should sincerely consider exempting our country from that bill he added canada is the united states largest trading partner with two way trade more than billion dlrs in according to the coalition but the u s ran up a billion dlr deficit in manufactured goods that year compared to a billion dlr surplus in services trade with its neighbour
