shortages and a foreign payments crisis announced last february the plan froze prices fixed the value of the new cruzado currency and ended widespread indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country s pct inflation rate but within a year the plan has all but collapsed the situation now is worse than it was although there was inflation at least the economy worked a leading bank economist said the crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account in and brazil s annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to cover the billion dlrs needed to service its billion dlr foreign debt for the first nine months of all seemed to be on target for a repeat with monthly surpluses averaging one billion dlrs but as exports were diverted and imports increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus plunged to mln dlrs in october and since then has averaged under mln  japan february interim trade surplus jumps japan s customs cleared

trade sanctions against south africa prime minister ingvar calrsson said carlsson told a news conference the party decided the fight against apartheid took priority over sweden s traditional policy of only adopting sanctions with the backing of the u n security council the government will decide later what form the trade boycott will take and when it will come into force  japan u s set to begin high level trade talks japan and the u s kick off top level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other the talks held annually at sub cabinet level to review the whole gamut of u s japan economic relations will pave the way for american secretary of state george schultz s one day stop over here at end week on his way home from china faced with growing congressional protectionist pressure the u s administration is pressing japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus u s officials said we appreciate their frustration a senior japanese government official said but we are also frustrated the official said the pct rise of the yen over the last months has hit japan hard forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad that has not yet shown up in dollar based statistics on trade but it will he said he said the u s administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with congress it would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments a senior u s official replied the talks begin tomorrow with high level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance which last year amounted to billion dlrs in japan s favour on the following two days the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt to such bilateral trade problems as super computers the structural talks are intended to be free wheeling discussions among senior officials tomorrow s topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing and the implications of government budget deficits these talks come at a particularly delicate time for the japanese government which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more some u s officials complained japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports as washington wants japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge u s budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance that budget deficit has meant that the u s is buying more imports japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices it condemns japan without due process one japanese official said that reference spoils what is otherwise a well thought out bill introduced by democratic senator lloyd bentsen he said japan is also not totally happy with the administration s trade bill particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the u s officials said nevertheless japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them we have no leverage one official admitted as a result tokyo is striving to meet u s complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields including super computers the u s is pressing for greater access to the japanese super computer market the japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers officials said  taiwan plans new tariff cuts taiwan plans another round of deep tariff cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the u s a senior economic planner said wang chao ming vice chairman of the council for economic planning and development told s taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on products sometime in the second half of this year cuts of up to pct on those items were made last year and wang said further cuts would go much deeper we have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially he said the united states taiwan s main trading partner has said the island s import tariffs still ranging from a high of almost pct were unacceptable it has criticised the cuts as too selective taiwan s trade surplus with the united states hit billion dlrs last year the surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to billion dlrs which wang said made taiwan a target for u s protectionism wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened taiwan s position in talks with washington over export quotas particularly for shoes textiles and machine tools which are among the island s main export earners a special taiwanese trade delegation leaves for washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of taiwan textiles under the accord taiwan s textile export growth was limited to pct each year until taipei has said it is losing markets to south korea and hong kong which were given more generous terms  talks show new canadian confidence group says canada s decision to raise the issue of a free trade pact with the u s was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of canadian self confidence a public policy study group said it suggests the canada of the immediate post war period when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world the washington based atlantic council said u s and canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries the world s biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments of about billion dlrs annually the council s study said the trade talks with a deadline of october for an agreement are the biggest issue in u s canadian relations the study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties the council said in the past most canadians have shied away from the notion of a free trade arrangement fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country times their size in population but at the same time it added canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world the council said that in the talks canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of u s duties against allegedly subsidized exports a recent example was the per cent duty the u s imposed on canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized the council said the chief u s concerns included ending curbs against u s banking insurance telecommunications and the so called cultural industries publishing broadcasting and films it said other major u s canadian issues were defense cooperation acid rain and the u s rejection of a canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the northwest passage  japan moves to tighten chip export curbs the ministry of international trade and industry miti acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the u s to preserve a u s japan pact on semiconductor trade but major japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness a miti spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters trading houses applying for a miti export licence will be required to show such a certificate but those without it will not automatically be denied licences he said but some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak u s government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the july agreement japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey market sales by third party brokers who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for japanese makers under the agreement the miti spokesman said if the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means in that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure miti earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by pct in first quarter spokesmen for the firms said but they doubt the usefulness of the latest move as long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money a hitachi ltd hit t spokesman said  swiss capital exports rise in january swiss capital exports rose to billion francs in january

united states to remove curbs on its exports to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology but the u s embassy replied that chinese figures showing years of trade deficits with the u s out of the last are inaccurate and said peking itself would have to persuade congress to change laws which limit its exports the official international business newspaper today published china s demands in a editorial to coincide with the visit of u s secretary of state george shultz it is extremely important that the u s market reduce its restrictions on chinese imports provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand chinese exports the editorial said the u s should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for chinese goods and admit china into the generalised system of preference gsp despite easing of curbs on u s technology exports in recent years control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries it added the paper also printed an article by china s commercial counsellor in its washington embassy chen shibiao who said that all kinds of difficulties and restrictions were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential he named them as u s protectionist behaviour curbs on technology transfer and out of date trade legislation the paper also printed a table showing that since bilateral trade began in china has had a deficit every year except and it shows the and deficits at billion and billion dlrs a u s embassy official said the u s did not accept peking s trade figures at all mainly because they exclude goods shipped to hong kong and then trans shipped to u s while u s figures are based on country of origin he said that if china wants to obtain gsp status it will have to lobby congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent peking getting such status the u s trade act of says that to qualify for gsp china must be a member of the general agreement of tariffs and trade gatt for which it applied in july and not be dominated or controlled by international communism the official said china was well aware of the laws some of which date to the anti communist early s but that there is not sufficient political will in the u s to change them china has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti dumping in the u s within the last two years which the u s side won he said but for the first time china signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods which may lead the u s side to withdraw the anti dumping case he added another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in peking s application to gatt china has the potential to disrupt world markets especially in textiles other gatt countries will be nervous about china in this respect but there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in gatt the diplomat said poland czechoslovakia hungary and romania are members of gatt but none has china s massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports in a speech today in the northeast city of dalian u s secretary of state george shultz said his country welcomed china s interest in participating in gatt the process of chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight the gatt rules were not designed for a large economy of the chinese type shultz said china can play an important role by actively joining gatt discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide china can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its gatt participation he said the problems facing u s china trade and gatt membership are similar a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs especially for exports and a de facto dual currency system in a memorandum backing its application presented to gatt last month china said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with guidance planning and economic levers the diplomat said that to join gatt china had much to do  u s asks japan end agriculture import controls the u s wants japan to eliminate import controls on agricultural products within three years visiting u s under secretary of state for economic affairs allen wallis told eishiro saito chairman of the federation of economic organisations keidanren a spokesman for keidanren said the spokesman quoted wallis as saying drastic measures would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by congress wallis who is attending a sub cabinet level bilateral trade meeting made the remark yesterday in talks with saito wallis was quoted as saying the reagan administration wants japanese cooperation so the white house can ensure any u s trade bill is a moderate one rather than containing retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country he was also quoted as saying the u s would be pleased were japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three the spokesman said japan currently restricts imports of agricultural products a ban on rice imports triggered recent u s complaints about japan s agricultural policy  china calls for better trade deal with u s china
