texas intermediate to dlrs a barrel the copany said the price reduction today was made in the light of falling oil product prices and a weak crude oil market a company spokeswoman said diamond is the

meet before a scheduled june session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices oil industry analysts said the movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as opec thought they may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems said daniel yergin director of cambridge energy research associates cera analysts and oil industry sources said the problem opec faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets opec s problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way said paul mlotok oil analyst with salomon brothers inc he said the market s earlier optimism about opec and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices but some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of opec production above the mln bpd quota set last december opec has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas fixed prices and set differentials said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named the market is now trying to teach them that lesson again he added david t mizrahi editor of mideast reports expects opec to meet before june although not immediately however he is not optimistic that opec can address its principal problems they will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil but in late march and april when demand slackens mizrahi said but mizrahi said that opec is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at mln bpd analysts said that the next two months will be critical for opec s ability to hold together prices and output opec must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then said dillard spriggs of petroleum analysis ltd in new york but bijan moussavar rahmani of harvard university s energy and environment policy center said that the demand for opec oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production demand for their opec oil is clearly above mln bpd and is probably closer to mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is opec meeting this demand through current production he told s in a telephone interview  texaco canada cuts crude prices canadian cts bbl par grade to canadian dlrs texaco canada txc lowers crude

for an emergency opec meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices sheikh ali al khalifa al sabah was quoted by the local daily al qabas as saying none of the opec members has asked for such a meeting he denied kuwait was pumping above its quota of barrels of crude daily bpd set under self imposed production limits of the nation organisation traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate opec is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of mln bpd agreed in geneva last december they named kuwait and the united arab emirates along with the much smaller producer ecuador among those producing above quota kuwait they said was pumping mln bpd this rumour is baseless it is based on reports which said kuwait has the ability to exceed its share they suppose that because kuwait has the ability it will do so the minister said sheikh ali has said before that kuwait had the ability to produce up to mln bpd if we can sell more than our quota at official prices while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share it means we in kuwait are unusually clever he said he was referring apparently to the gulf state of qatar which industry sources said was selling less than bpd of its bpd quota because buyers were resisting official prices restored by opec last month pegged to a marker of dlrs per barrel prices in new york last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three month high of dollars a barrel sheikh ali also delivered a challenge to any international oil company that declared kuwait sold below official prices because it was charging its official price of dlrs a barrel it had lost custom he said but did not elaborate however kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad he added he reaffirmed that the planned meeting march of opec s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of april at the request of certain of the body s members ecuador s deputy energy minister fernando santos alvite said last wednesday his debt burdened country wanted opec to assign a lower official price for its crude and was to seek this at talks this month of opec s pricing committee referring to pressure by oil companies on opec members in apparent reference to difficulties faced by qatar he said we expected such pressure it will continue through march and april but he expected the situation would later improve  indonesia seen at crossroads over economic change indonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy the u s embassy says in a new report to counter falling oil revenues the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment indonesia the only asian member of opec and a leading primary commodity producer has been severely hit by last year s fall in world oil prices which forced it to devalue its currency by pct in september but the u s embassy report says president suharto s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy it appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation both as it pertains to investments and imports the report says it primarily assesses indonesia s agricultural sector but also reviews the country s general economic performance it says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves this group strongly favours an import substitution economy the report says indonesia s economic changes have been welcomed by the world bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected and virtual monopolies three sets of measures have been announced since last may which broadened areas for foreign investment reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports the report says indonesia s economic growth in calendar was probably about zero and the economy may even have contracted a bit this is the lowest rate of growth since the mid s the report notes indonesia the largest country in south east asia with a population of million is facing general elections in april but the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook for early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry growth in the non oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity real declines in construction and trade and a reduced level of growth in agriculture the report states bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs a new world bank loan of mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform the bank

accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance nazer quoted by spa said recent pressure on free market prices may be because of the end of the northern hemisphere winter season and the glut in the market saudi arabia was a main architect of the december accord under which opec agreed to lower its total output ceiling by pct to mln barrels

oil storage at both ends of the pipeline an ammonia complex at lazaro cardenas on the pacific coast and expansion of the infrastructure of the port of salina cruz ayala said pemex will buy mln dlrs

rallied today moving over dlrs a barrel because of saudi arabia s determined effort to support prices analysts said the saudis and other opec nations are jawboning the market hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting said sanford margoshes oil analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc but opec is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating he added oil industry analysts said saudi arabia has led the attempt to get other opec members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december the analysts said that to get others to hold the line saudi arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the gulf cooperation council last weekend and at the cooperation council oil ministers meeting the previous week the saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil analysts said they are trying to make sure that no one discounts and to prevent that it appears that saudi arabia or some other opec member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales margoshes said he added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like qatar which has had trouble selling oil but it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts analysts said that saudi arabia with assistance from opec president rilwanu lukman was trying to avoid an emergency opec meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the december pact is falling apart daniel mckinley oil analyst with smith barney upham harris and co said both physical

reported as high as dlrs up one dlr opec members denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions indonesian oil minister subroto said today that opec production was below the mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on opec production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level the production probably is about their quota level and largely because saudi arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result margoshes said analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally some believe prices can continue to rise if saudi arabia and opec hold steady in a refusal to discount but others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors including demand which could cut the rally short marion stewart an indepedent petroleum economist said slow growth in the economies of the u s and oecd would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that

exporting countries to stay within their production quotas said morgan stanley group managing director john wellemeyer wellemeyer speaking to reporters at an offshore oil engineering conference also said he expected opec nations to attempt to hold prices under dlrs a barrel for several years to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong over the next few weeks i think you ll see a concerted effort by the saudis to get production down wellemeyer said the saudis are committed to that price level of dlrs a barrel and are willing to make it happen again he said in recent weeks oil prices fell to the to dlrs a barrel level on market reports of some ope members producing above their quota pushing total opec production to mln barrels per day but prices rebounded today with april u s crude prices up about one dlr to over dlrs a barrel on a belief saudi arabia is attempting to curb opec output wellemeyer said that sharp declines in u s oil production could push demand for opec oil above mln barrels per day as early as and up to mln barrels per day by although the projected increases in demand for opec oil should strengthen world prices wellemeyer said he believed the organization would hold its official price below dlrs a barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from switching to natural gas supplies the interfuel swing market accounts for about eight

continue at last year s sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices industry analysts said because much of the crude oil in california fields is thick heavy and expensive to extract oil prices would have to increase to near s levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling they said companies will probably only drill their best prospects said john curti an analyst with birr wilson securities inc few new wells now are being drilled only rigs about one quarter of the total available were drilling for oil onshore in california last week compared to about last year said bill bolster of munger oil information services which tracks california drilling activity it s in the dregs right now said bolster of the state s drilling activity current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling said ed malmgreen of the california independent producers association while an organization of petroleum exporting countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year prices eventually fell prices for california s marker grade line blend have slumped about pct in the last month to dlrs from a high of about dlrs more than half of california s oil comes from stripper wells those producing less than barrels a day and that much of that oil costs between and dlrs a barrel to extract malmgreen said it s not unusual for a stripper well to cost dlrs malmgreen said many stripper wells along the southern california coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick heavy oil he said the outlook for future production in california is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now analysts said in the heart of california s oil patch kern county which produces about two thirds of the state s oil exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl only exploratory wells were drilled in kern county in compared to in according to david mitchell of the state energy commission so far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled i don t think they ll even get to what they did last year mitchell said no pickup in exploratory

the number of producing oil wells in california fell pct to from more than said bill guerard of the california energy commission in line with that decrease california s crude oil output fell about pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level analysts said between february and october california s crude oil production slipped from an all time high of mln barrels

wells nugent said in a speech to the texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding u s energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers his proposal to revitalize texas oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce barrels of oil or less each day from the state s pct severance tax he said that the majority of texas oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves secondary and tertiary oil production expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil should also be exempted from the severance tax nugent said his plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years or until the price of oil reaches a barrel we ve been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow i say we have waited long enough nugent said in other words let s tell washington to either lead follow or get out of the way nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry  murphy raises crude oil posted

average for february and well below the mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in december a  survey shows the figures were polled by s correspondents from oil traders industry executives and analysts in europe the middle east africa latin america and asia they back recent statements by opec ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system which came into effect last month opec output for the whole of february was about bpd above the ceiling largely because of overproduction by the united arab emirates and kuwait the figures show the uae together with the much smaller producer ecuador was also producing above quota in the first days of march the survey reveals but such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in saudi arabian output together with iran s inability to export as much as its quota allows iraq rejected its opec quota of mln bpd and produced mln bpd in february and early march the figures showed saudi output excluding movements into stocks fell to mln bpd in early march from mln bpd in february against a mln bpd quota the saudi figures include a bpd share of neutral zone production kuwait which has consistently denied quota violations was estimated to be pumping mln bpd in february and in early march both figures including bpd as its share of neutral zone output against its bpd quota reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some opec states were reflected in output from qatar and nigeria both substantially under quota in february and early march qatar s february output was bpd

under ceiling opec output in february was well below the mln bpd ceiling it set in december and all countries are strictly adhering to their quotas the opec news agency opecna quoted an opec secretariat official as saying the official was quoted as saying that lower output was the result of member countries firm determination to defend the organisation s official price of dlrs per barrel and to refrain from selling any quantity below that price the unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no opec meeting was foreseen before the next biannual opec session planned to start on june the official gave no figure for february output the statement said only that the reduction in total supplies namely actual exports of crude oil and products plus local deliveries in member countries is even more pronounced as those supplies fell very noticeably during that month no matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters to align the official selling price to the ongoing market price member countries are without exception strictly adhering to the official selling price in spite of the financial hardship this may entail the statement said the very recent improvement in the price structure is an indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to the official selling price the statement said free spot market prices rose from around dlrs a barrel in early december last year to near opec s official levels towards the end of the year after the opec pact there has been oil industry speculation that opec might have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled june session to discuss reports of overproduction by some states and strains on the differential matrix which prices each opec crude according to its quality and distance from main markets the official said in the statement that no such emergency session was scheduled because of member countries firm determination to defend the price system agreed in december opec s differential committee was to have met in vienna starting april but this session has been postponed with no new date set according to an official of the united arab emirates which chairs the seven state body other

third of its output currently sells its top suez and ras bahar blends for dlrs a barrel  opec president says output well below ceiling opec conference president rilwanu lukman said the group was producing well below the mln bpd ceiling it set in december partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed opec prices lukman during a brief visit to london on his way home from jamaica told s in a telephone interview that in february opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around dlrs a barrel we are determined to stand firm by the december accord he said i have spoken to every other opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work he said lukman gave no specific figures for february output he said the opec secretariat in vienna was finalizing these figures told of a s survey published today which estimated that opec output so far this week was below mln bpd he said that could well be correct opec s news agency opecna today issued a statement saying group output was well below its ceiling in february but it gave no figures but one source close to opec indicated that february output may have been between and mln bpd the  survey estimated opec february output at around mln bpd opec agreed in december to cut output by pct to mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting february lukman said qatar nigeria saudi arabia and iran had all produced in february below their opec quotas iraq which said it would not honour its mln bpd quota under the december pact had produced less than had been anticipated he said lukman said that some industry reports may be correct that in february nigeria propuced bpd below its mln bpd quota saudi arabia bpd less than its mln allocation and qatar to pct under its bpd quota he said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet north sea grades and the united states west texas intermediate wti crude however he said opec in december had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks we have to be patient for two or three weeks the market is now firming on actual fundamentals he said adding that he expected it to go up and up even beyond official prices after early april this is when traditionally there is more demand for gasoline rich crudes such as nigeria s the opec president said producers such as kuwait venezuela and indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products also some of venezuela s heavy grades were outside the opec pricing system he said lukman said that if refiner buyers now refusing to lift some opec oil at official prices instead used their own stocks and ran them down to dangerous levels they would eventually have to buy opec oil when they realise it is not a free for all in the market they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on he said lukman asked about industry reports that nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable flexible and under constant review not only when the market seemed weak he said that so far no meeting of the seven nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting now twice postponed was not a high priority for opec at the moment at this time we have to get our priorities right he said the most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working not dealing with a differential of cents between grades but if any opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system a meeting would be called he said

february crude output mln bpd opec produced an average mln barrels per day bpd of crude oil in february down from mln the previous month and an overall mln bpd in fourth quarter the international energy agency said a few opec countries last month exceeded the production quotas set at their last conference in december but liftings were reduced from several countries it said in its latest

an energy and mines ministry statement said it said the state oil firm corporacion estatal petrolera ecuatoriana cepe notified foreign customers that it was declaring force majeure on its crude exports due to the tremor ecuador s opec oil output quota is barrels per day bpd a senior energy ministry official said that one pumping station at el salado on ecuador s main pipeline was damaged he also said an metre section of the pipeline attached to the bridge over the aguarico river collapsed the pumping station was about km from the reventador volcano near the epicentre of the quake which ecuadorean seismologists said registered six on the point international mercalli scale the aguarico bridge was also close to the volcano he said the quake struck northern ecaudor and southern colombia according to ecuadorean officials no injuries were reported  colombian oil exports not affected by quake colombian oil installations were not damaged by an earthquake which shook ecuador and southern colombia last night and there are no plans to suspend exports a spokesman for the state run oil company ecopetrol said he said no damage was reported unlike in ecuador where indefinite force majeure was declared on crude exports colombia currently produces about barrels per day bpd of crude exports in january totalled bpd the quake which in colombia measured between and seven on the point international mercalli scale caused panic among residents but no injuries were reported  crude oil prices up as stocks output fall u s crude oil prices rose above dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price could rise another dollar as inventories fall opec is keeping its production down and in the cash market there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time to major refining centers said daniel mckinley oil analyst with smith barney harris upham and co that could send prices cts to a dollar higher he added the u s benchmark crude west texas intermediate rose to dlrs a barrel today a rise of dlrs this week the rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in february more than two dlrs from its high of dlrs a barrel oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that oil stocks were building and opec was producing well above its mln bpd quota but now both of those assumptions have come under question mckinley said yesterday the international energy agency in its monthly report said that oil stocks in the oecd area or in industrialized nations were drawn down by mln bpd during the first quarter of this year iea estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose inventory levels by april one will be an estimated mln tonnes or about days consumption industry analysts also said the estimate of a mln bpd draw in stocks made by shell chairman peter holmes yesterday fed speculation that other major companies were destocking traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a so called buyers strike which kept refiners from buying officially priced opec oil in an effort to get the organization to offer discounts to the official price this struggle between the companies and opec is the ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively soon i would imagine by about the middle of the month march the general trading manager of an international oil company told s in a telephone interview for its part opec has moved to win this game by cutting excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own output traders said a  survey estimates opec output to be mln bpd this week also an earthquake in ecuador yesterday led it to suspend oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments this will reduce short haul availabilities by about bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting it to be there mckinley said international oil traders said that other short haul crudes such as north sea brent were also scarce because asian refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily available mideast crudes earlier this week if this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries trading managers at several companies told s but there were skeptics who said they wondered how long opec can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues stephen hanke chief economist at friedburg commodity management said opec production was lower because of the saudi cut to mln bpd and this could spell trouble if it gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas he added the saudis will be picking up the tab for other members who produce over their quota and the drain on the saudis will continue forcing them to cut output maybe as low as mln bpd to support the dlrs average price he added there are also signs of some opec crudes being sold in the spot market at below opec official prices traders said oil traders said nigerian brass river sold for delivery into the u s gulf at a price related to north sea brent which traded this week at dlrs far below the official price of dlrs for the similar quality bonny light iranian oil is also surfacing in the u s gulf and the far east at reported discounts to its dlrs official price there is a lot of oil priced on government

reaffirms commitment to fixed prices ceiling opec has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of mln barrels per day bpd to defend prices its president rilwanu lukman said he told a news conference here after due consultation with my colleagues in opec i hereby wish to emphasize that nigeria and all member countries of opec remain determined to uphold the december agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices lukman added no extraordinary opec conference was planned we are in a position to re confirm that despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary opec member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of february lukman who is nigerian oil minister said lukman put the overall opec output shortfall in february at bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of dlrs agreed upon last december in geneva the december agreement set an overall output ceiling for opec of mln bpd for first half and restored fixed prices as from february around a reference point of dlrs oil prices rallied immediately after the geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that opec was producing more than the agreed level the idea was to suggest that opec s agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of opec oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs lukman said he said the bpd shortfall last february was based on the verified figure for out of opec s members adding that nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of bpd iraq disassociated itself from the december agreement while the production figures of ecuador and the united arab emirates needed to be verified lukman said if that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed we are ready opec is not changing its price level of dlrs the group s president said he said the opec price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to april had been put off indefinitely furthermore no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in december are being adhered to he said asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various opec crudes fixed in relation to the dlr benchmark lukman replied we consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials lukman said opec was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude we don t see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the dlr price throughout the rest of the year lukman said the opec president praised non opec oil producers which he said had contributed to the group s efforts to stabilise prices but he criticised britain for maintaining its long held view not to do anything to help the market we are quite confident however that in the long term with two thirds of the world s reserves in opec hands the future is ours we will use that advantage responsibly he said lukman described the disruption in ecuador s output following an earthquake as tragic but refused to say if the south american country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster  triton energy oil affiliate in canadian find triton energy corp said its pct owned canadian worldwide energy ltd affiliate s lasmo et al
