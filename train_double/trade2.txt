gatt warns u s on federal budget protectionism the united states emphasis on its foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country s real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit the general agreeement on tariffs and trade gatt said by stressing its record trade deficit of billion dlrs last year the u s was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system it said in an annual report the fundamental problem the size of the u s federal budget deficit could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt it said gatt also predicted world trade would grow by only pct in a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years gatt experts urged washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit higher private savings lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit raising u s trade barriers would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit it would however increase inflation and reduce world trade it said the basic cause some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit would remain the report said gatt economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in japan and some west european nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar risk of higher u s inflation concerns over third world debt management and looming protectionism the report also said imbalances in the current accounts of japan west germany and the u s had increased in the most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies it added thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year the report said gatt warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the u s inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates which in turn would adversely affect world trade but the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the united states despite the dollar s depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive it suggested that resources idle in the u s both human and in underutilised factories were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad world trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in about half of the rate of the previous year trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade gatt said developing countries exports declined significantly while their imports increased moderately although full statistics are not available yet gatt said the combined export earnings of major indebted nations were sharply lower and only five of them chile colombia philippines south korea and thailand had higher exports reuter

nakasone hard pressed to soothe u s anger on trade prime minister yasuhiro nakasone will visit washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting u s anger over japanese trade policies but western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans nakasone will be hard pressed to come up with anything new to tell u s president ronald reagan and key u s congressmen they said news of the week long visit starting april coincided with news that japan recorded a billion dlr trade surplus last month more than pct higher than a year earlier it also came one day after the reagan administration s economic policy council decided to take retaliatory action against japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages one designed to pep up japan s sagging economy and imports in the short term the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over dependence on exports for growth but government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short term economic measures until after its budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate but his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the u s virtually empty handed nakasone today ordered his ruling liberal democratic party ldp to come up with its own measures he can then tell reagan the ldp package will form the basis of the government s plans without losing face in parliament over the budget political analysts said officials working on the government s short term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations deregulation measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices and accelerated public investment they said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire fiscal year will take place in the first half probably over pct diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy reagan who is under pressure from the democrat controlled u s congress to take greater action to cut the huge american trade deficit to complement the short term measures nakasone is also likely to present reagan with details of japan s longer term economic plans a high ranking advisory body headed by former bank of japan governor haruo maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before nakasone is scheduled to leave for washington its recommendations are designed as a follow up to maekawa s report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy officials said while wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee s recommendations a subcommittee is considering what the japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring officials said the subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of japan s total output or gross national product around or last year the surplus which measures trade in goods and services amounted to over four pct of gnp the subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual appreciation of the yen to about to the dollar by around from now reuter
