gulf bond stock markets lag behind gib says gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind gulf international bank bsc gib said the bank s economist henry azzam said in a review of gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts he said the gib study reviewed capital markets under three categories money markets stock and bond markets azzam said gulf states had been making greater use of short term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities nevertheless bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lagging behind he said most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues only kuwait has an official stock exchange while other gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges but with dwindling financial surpluses in the gulf governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges azzam said he said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region in addition family firms are reluctant to go public financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth a sharp fall in share prices in the early s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some gulf countries and authorities apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets he called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of gulf cooperation council gcc states bahrain kuwait qatar oman saudi arabia and the united arab emirates uae some moves had been taken in this direction with bahrain allowing gcc nationals to own up to pct of locally incorporated companies azzam said gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in saudi arabia but he added there is no bond market to speak of in saudi arabia qatar oman or the uae with the last saudi riyal denominated bond issued in while bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in saudi arabia has picked up establishment of formal exchanges in qatar oman and the uae does not appear imminent azzam said  zambia to retain currency auction says kaunda zambia will retain its foreign exchange auction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions since january president kenneth kaunda said we have not run away from the auction it hasn t been abolished at all he told s in an interview he said the system would be reintroduced after current talks with the world bank and the international monetary fund and he hoped would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private bidders but not to fix the exchange rate kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the government s shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand it was suspended when the kwacha s rapid devaluation and strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible for the government and the private sector he said weekly foreign exchange auctions began in october the kwacha fell from to the dollar to about in months in january the government was more than two months in arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders and the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha to the dollar  philippine planning chief urges peso devaluation the philippines must devalue the peso if it wants its exports to remain competitive economic planning secretary solita monsod told s the peso dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports more competitive monsod said an interview no question about it i m saying you cannot argue with success taiwan south korea west germany japan all those miracle economies deliberately undervalued their currencies the peso has been free floating since june it is currently at about to the u s dollar finance secretary jaime ongpin has said the government does not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and able to continue to respond to market conditions monsod said ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from the point of view of finance if the dollar rate goes higher our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher so the financing is very difficult she said but i am looking at it in terms of the economy she said she was not trying to oppose official policy i m just saying keep it competitive i do not want it to become uncompetitive because then we are dead monsod said the ideal movement in the peso dollar rate is a movement that will reflect differences in inflation rates of the philippines versus the other country it s an arithmetic thing official figures show philippine inflation averaged pct in calendar ongpin told reporters on saturday it was expected to touch five pct this year he said the government and the international monetary fund had set the peso dollar target rate at the peso lost pct in value to slump to to the dollar when it was floated in  former treasury official urges currency reforms former treasury official c fred bergsten said a new exchange rate system is needed to replace the fixed and flexible exchange rate systems which he said had not worked i prefer a move to target zones in which the major countries would determine ranges of pct within which they would pledge to hold their exchange rates by direct intervention and as necessary by changes in monetary and other policies bergsten now the director of the institute for international economics said in a statement to a house banking subcommittee the substantial correction of the exchange rate that has occurred since early is enormously welcome and should produce a sizeable reduction in the u s trade deficit this year and next but the imbalance will not fall much below billion dlrs on present policies so much more is needed he said  u k money market given mln stg late help the bank of england said

central bank said the naira finished at to the dollar against last week only mln dlrs of the mln dlrs on offer was sold with all bidding banks successfully obtaining hard currency the effective rate including a central bank levy for transactions in the coming week was against last week the failure to sell the whole allocation was due to the central bank s unprecedented disqualification of banks

the past that many are failing to produce the right paperwork within the specified time  egyptian central bank dollar rate unchanged egypt s central bank today set the dollar rate for commercial banks

those countries said u s trade representative clayton yeutter speaking to the asia society yeutter said that it is in those countries own long term interest to raise the value of their currencies against the dollar yeutter was responding to a question about what the u s could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against the dollar in order to reduce the large u s trade deficits with taiwain and korea an undervalued currency will help those countries exports in the short term but in the long run they have to be concerned about how they are perceived in the international business community yeutter said for taiwan yeutter said that with its per capita trade surplus with the u s much larger than that of japan s and with huge foreign exchange reserves it was difficult to defend the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that country he also said that the south korean won should begin to move to reflect underlying economic fundamentals otherwise in two or three years time korea will be in the same situation that prevails in taiwan turning to the u s deficit with japan of more than billion dlrs yeutter said that this situation was not sustainable something must give soon if not there is a great threat of u s legislative action to counteract that trend yeutter said  u k money market deficit revised to mln stg the bank of england said it had

assistance  economic spotlight ems marks eighth birthday the european monetary system marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in europe economists say but many economists say the system which holds eight european community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands remains in its infancy its new currency the european currency unit ecu has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar and on wednesday the long term vision of the ecu as europe s common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when belgium minted the world s first ecu coin but economists say members such as west germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system s founding fathers ex west german chancellor helmut schmidt and former french president valery giscard d estaing under this phase originally due to have started two years after the ems was set up decision making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous european monetary fund but members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters the basic problem of the ems is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common said one economist who has closely watched the system s development the result is that the ec is often divided over policy on third currencies accentuating what the economists say is the system s greatest weakness its vulnerability to a weak dollar over the past months as the u s dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies the resulting sharp rise of the west german mark severely strained the system more as the mark soared against the dollar it also rose against ems currencies less favoured by international investors and as west germany last year refused to give in pressure from several ec partners and the united states to cut interest rates to slow the mark s rise the ems had to be realigned twice to ease financial and trade strains within the community two months ago the mark and the dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the belgian and luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system the french franc italian lira the irish punt and danish crown another frustration has been britain s failure to lend the ems political support by keeping the pound still a major world currency outside the system no change in the british government s attitude is expected before the country s next general elections due by mid meanwhile the system s last realignment the th since it was set up prompted european finance ministers to ask the ec s highly secretive monetary committee and committee of central bank governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in belgium early next month but economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details they are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change technical measures won t be enough to protect the ems against external factors such as dollar weakness for that we must take the step forward to the institutional level said leo de corel of kredietbank s economic research department economists say the system s fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates if the dollar resumes its slide the ems could be in for more turbulence they predict  france repays some of currency intervention debt france today repaid billion francs of short term currency intervention debt to the european monetary cooperation fund emcf the finance ministry said it said the debt was part of a billion franc liability incurred through the activation of emcf swap

exchange market s first test of the industrialized nations recent pact to stabilize currencies analysts said in active trading this week the market pushed the dollar sterling the canadian dollar and australian dollar higher but operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central banks signalled their displeasure so far g has been a roaring success said james o neill financial markets economist at marine midland bank na the central banks are sending strong signals that they won t tolerate any kind of momentum building behind currencies added a senior corporate trader at one u k bank on february the finance ministers and central bank governors of the u s japan west germany france and the u k the group of five plus canada signed an accord under which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around prevailing levels the agreement was viewed by many in the market as an attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable two year decline against major world currencies and initially traders indicated their respect for the accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower but by wednesday the dollar climbed to more than marks about five pfennigs above its levels the friday before the g accord the move was aided by indications that the u s economy picked up steam in february at the same time as the west german economy was regressing but dealers said the federal reserve bank of new york gave traders a sharp reminder that the g pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines dealers differed as to whether the u s central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above marks or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions but the dollar quickly backed off it hovered today around marks the market was surprised that the fed showed its face so soon said marine midland na s o neill also on wednesday london dealers said the bank of england intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the u k currency rose to dlrs compared with dlrs before the g pact sterling along with the other high yield currencies like the australian dollar and canadian dollar was in favor after traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant to the paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays on dollar mark and dollar yen the pound

of u s cents today from a high of thursday analysts said the central banks moves to stifle sudden upward movement leave the market uncertain about its next step today the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a very tight range against the dollar for several months the dollar fell to yen from last night analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long sterling short mark positions established lately because of the change in perceptions about the health of the german economy the funds from those unwinding operations are ending up in yen a dealer at one u k bank said recent west german data have shown falling industry orders lower industrial output and slowing employment gains moreover the yen is benefitting as japanese entities who have invested heavily overseas for example in australian financial instruments repatriate their profits ahead of the end of the japanese fiscal year on march noting that the dollar yen rate is in a sense the most controversial one

exchange market through the end of january the federal reserve revealed that it intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on january on that day the dollar fell as low as yen sure the fed bought dollars near the yen level in january but the market has to bear in mind that time marches on and the situation changes said mcgroarty of discount  leading industrial nations to meet in april leading industrial nations will meet again next month to review their accord on currency stability but u s officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth the narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month s talks seem likely to build on that stability a reagan administration official said the paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm but he said in an interview that financial markets also understood that all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels that is in fact what has happened since paris monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short term policy objectives instead they have focused on medium term policy goals but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings the official refused to comment however on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year on february the united states japan west germany france britain and canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions given commitments by washington to cut its budget deficit and by toyko and bonn to boost economic growth the shake up would strengthen the u s position in future international talks i think these changes will strengthen the president s hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the congress and the better off we are in international fora said the official an administration economic policymaker so it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives but the official also said the administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit a target europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability last week dealers said the federal reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark which had breached to the dollar british authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling s strength international monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers who will review market performance and their own economic prospects will reassemble

james baker since paris there are signs west german growth is slowing while u s officials said they were giving japan until april to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing signs of concern about german prospects emerged recently when bundesbank central bank president karl otto poehl told bankers he would consider cutting west german interest rates if the fed was ready to follow suit a reagan administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in germany but he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the fed and the bundesbank if there is such a provision it is private and if i talked about it it would no longer be private said the official who asked not to be identified public comments by fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the u s trade deficit remains stubbornly high further coordinated action could be on the april agenda  taiwan says u s wants taiwan dollar to appreciate the united states wants taiwan s currency to appreciate faster to reduce taiwan s trade surplus with

problems over food subsidies zambia s talks with the world bank and international monetary fund imf on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies an official newspaper said the times of zambia which is run by the ruling united national independence party unip quoted official sources as saying the imf and world bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them president kenneth kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last december in line with imf recommendations but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots in which people were killed the subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances but they are estimated to cost the government about mln kwacha per year the times of zambia said another major issue in the government s current talks with the imf and world bank was the remodelling of zambia s foreign exchange auction the central bank s weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of january pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate the kwacha slid to around per dollar under the auction system losing pct of its value in months however since the end of january it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar banking sources said zambia was persuaded by the world bank and imf to lift its proposed ceiling of kwacha per dollar on the currency s devaluation once the auctions

balance sheet activities in an attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated capital market instruments banking sources said interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under closest scrutiny and if revisions are made they may resemble regulation jointly proposed by the u s and u k to japan juergen becker director of the bundesbank s division of banking law and credit supervision said the u s british proposals were interesting but declined to elaborate but banking sources said west germany was more likely to produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals there is no formal plan yet but talks are in the latter stages one representative of the german banking association in cologne said bankers expect rule changes this year all alterations must be approved by the bundesbank west germany s four major banking associations and the federal banking supervisory office talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes would require a revision of germany s credit law which has been in effect since authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it banking sources said since the beginning of the banking law has limited banks lending to times shareholders equity plus reserves on a consolidated basis but lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts currency and interest swaps commercial paper programs currency options interest rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of interest rate hedges the sources said the main value of the u s u k proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor and for instance in placing greater weight on currency swaps than interest swaps but even if german banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk u s british proposals include a complicated series of formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in swaps whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial intermediary especially when counterparties remain anonymous this is the so called market to market value but german authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved the sources said the weightings also likely if lending ratios are extended to include banks securities portfolios are zero for public authorities pct for domestic banks pct for foreign banks and pct for other foreign and non bank borrowers a further complication is that the more flexible definitions of equity allowed in the u s and the u k may put german banks at a competitive disadvantage the sources said stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of the u s u k proposals could far exceed the intent of the u s and british authorities the sources said one specialist for dresdner bank ag said a long dated foreign exchange forward transaction could for instance be brought under the same rule as a cross currency swap despite the fact that the risk may be entirely different how new regulations will affect foreign banks here was uncertain many have converted to full subsidiary status and applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in order to lead manage mark eurobonds but as their equity capital is fairly small tight lending ratios will severely hamper foreign banks freedom of movement particularly in the growing business of currency swaps if they are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet the sources added  u k money market offered early assistance the bank of england said it invited an early round of bill offers from discount houses after forecasting a shortage in the system of some billion stg among the main factors affecting liquidity bills maturing in official hands and treasury bill take up will drain some billion stg while exchequer transactions will take out around mln stg and bankers balances below target five mln

vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in europe economists say but many economists say the system which holds eight european community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands remains in its infancy its new currency the european currency unit ecu has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar and on wednesday the long term vision of the ecu as europe s common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when belgium minted the world s first ecu coin but economists say members such as west germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system s founding fathers ex west german chancellor helmut schmidt and former french president valery giscard d estaing under this phase originally due to have started two years after the ems was set up decision making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous european monetary fund but members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters the basic problem of the ems is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common said one economist who has closely watched the system s development the result is that the ec is often divided over policy on third currencies accentuating what the economists say is the system s greatest weakness its vulnerability to a weak dollar over the past months as the u s dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies the resulting sharp rise of the west german mark severely strained the system another frustration has been britain s failure to lend the ems political support by keeping the pound still a major world currency outside the system no change in the british government s attitude is expected before the country s next general elections due by mid meanwhile the system s last realignment the th since it was set up prompted european finance ministers to ask the ec s highly secretive monetary committee and committee of central bank governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in belgium early next month but economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details they are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change technical measures won t be enough to protect the ems against external factors such as dollar weakness for that we must take the step forward to the institutional level said leo de corel of kredietbank s economic research department economists say the system s fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates if the dollar resumes its slide the ems could be in for more turbulence they predict  fed says it sets

is bearish and operators may push the currency to a new low unless japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the paris accord foreign exchange analysts polled by s said here the dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of yen and to fall even below that level a senior dealer at one leading bank said the dollar has eased this week but remains stable at around yen six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in paris in february to foster currency stability some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term but a drastic fall is unlikely because of u s fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced japanese purchases of u s treasury securities needed to finance the u s deficit dealers generally doubted whether any economic package japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly and said such measures would probably invite further u s steps to weaken the dollar under the paris accord tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal budget was passed to boost domestic demand increase imports and cut its trade surplus but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future the dealers said if no such steps are taken protectionist sentiment in the u s congress will grow putting greater downward pressure on the dollar they said the factors affecting the u s currency have not changed since before the paris accord they added underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still sluggish u s economic outlook the international debt crisis triggered by brazil s unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the reagan administration as a result of the iran contra arms scandal said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank there is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around yen by the end of this year said chemical bank tokyo branch vice president yukuo takahashi but operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention dealers said there were widespread rumours that the u s federal reserve telephoned some banks in new york to ask for quotes last wednesday and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to marks the bank of england also apparently sold sterling in london when it neared dlrs on wednesday they said but other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention saying it may stimulate the dollar s decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars however first national bank of chicago tokyo branch assistant manager hiroshi mochizuki said the dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of march other dealers said the u s seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on march because a weak dollar would give japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings which could make them lose interest in purchases of u s treasury securities u s monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates they said  u k

foreign exchange auction at the end of this month as part of a new two tier exchange rate central bank governor leonard chivuno said chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeks of negotiations with the international monetary fund imf that there would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactions and a fluctuating rate decided by the auction for other types of business the bank of zambia previously held weekly auctions to distribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determine the kwacha s exchange rate but these were suspended at the end of january president kenneth kaunda said at the time that he was suspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluation and violent fluctations of the exchange rate which had resulted business and banking sources said another reason for suspending the auction was that the central bank was low on foreign exchange and was weeks behind in paying successful bidders the kwacha stood at per dollar when the auction system was first introduced in october but it slid to around per dollar by the time it was suspended months later since then zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of about nine kwacha per dollar

preferable the report also favoured retention of the lira s six pct oscillation band with the european monetary system ems during the liberalization process in order to lessen short term domestic

dollar at current levels when the trade deficit hit a record level last year baker said in the newspaper interview that it was a subject i prefer not to talk about he said that if he explained why the u s agreed to help maintain the dollar at current levels i would of necessity end up getting into some of the private agreements that support such and agreement on the dollar baker was optimistic about brazil which has stopped interest payments on much of its outstanding debt with foreign commercial banks they are after all paying on time all the debt service and principal on their official

march by introducing a maximum credit amount and a penalty rate if banks exceed this ceiling the recent introduction of three month money and these new regulations are decreasing the role of the call

had never before been allowed to issue its own cds they said the central bank for the first time has an instrument with which it really can influence the price of money in this country one banker said

the herald daily newspaper unfortunate and completely unfounded speculation that a depreciation of the zimbabwe dollar was about to occur had aggravated a serious foreign exchange shortage during february and the early part of march this speculation caused importers to bring forward their payments and exporters to delay as long as possible the inward remittance of export receipts resulting in a significant slowdown in net foreign exchange inflows he added  nigeria changes auction rules to defend the naira nigeria s central bank has changed the rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts see as a means of defending the naira currency which has depreciated steadily the bank said in a statement that from april banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not as presently at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction this should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower marginal rate analysts said it should act as a brake because banks will know that if they bid high they will have to pay what they offered a western diplomat commented the naira has depreciated against the dollar by pct since the auctions known as the second tier foreign exchange market sfem began last september at last week s session the nigerian currency was fixed at to the dollar the third fall in a row they were clearly worried and this is the logical way of trying to stop the trend the diplomat said the central bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly not weekly beginning on april it was not immediately clear whether next thursday s scheduled session would still take place nor if the bank was planning to double the mln dlrs which are normally on offer at each auction demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped supply encouraging banks to bid high and thus further weakening the naira if the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the fortnightly session high demand could undermine the objective of the new system analysts said although bidding banks will now pay what they offered the official exchange rate for the naira applying to business transactions will continue to be the marginal rate the lowest successful bid sfem is a central part of nigeria s structural adjustment program which is considered to be the most ambitious economic recovery plan in black africa the program involves setting a realistic exchange rate for the naira which was over valued for many years liberalising imports boosting agriculture removing subsidies and reducing inefficient government participation in the economy the world bank has played a prominent part in designing this dramatic blue print and in selling it to an often sceptical public which fears inflation and lower living standards ishrat husain the world bank s representative in nigeria said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment program as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions so far so good he told a meeting of bankers in lagos adding that only members of nigeria s import dependent elite would suffer hardship while the common man would benefit fears that the program would encourage inflation were incorrect he said bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urban prices had already reflected the naira s black market value before the currency was allowed to find its true level last september  u s credit market outlook mini refunding a hefty slice of new u s treasury supply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit market but at least this week s offerings should provide it with some focus economists said banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to work so the auctions should breathe some life into the market said economists at merrill lynch capital markets inc the treasury will place a billion dlr package of two year four year and seven year notes on the sales block this week the mini refunding which will raise billion dlrs in new cash comprises billion dlrs of two year notes for auction on tuesday billion dlrs of four year notes on wednesday and billion dlrs of seven year notes on thursday the market also faces the regular weekly three and six month bill auction today amounting to billion dlrs the mini refunding does not come at a particularly auspicious time for the market bond prices have been drifting sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy u s economic outlook diminished chances of a change in federal reserve board policy and a stable dollar moreover the bond market s inertia has compared unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in high yield markets overseas like the u k as well as in u s equities but according to the merrill lynch economists there are signs the pall hanging over the u s bond market is lifting a bit customer activity has been light but all on the buy side and there is a marked absence of selling they said in a weekly report philip braverman of irving trust securities inc believes banks will snap up the two and four year issues at this week s sales the banks are in need of investments that provide earnings though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these maturities has been wider it is still positive he said in a weekly market review but economists agreed not even the auctions will generate enough impetus for a major move this will only come once the overseas markets have had their run based on last week s events there is little to indicate that the appetite for yield has begun to wane said economists at salomon brothers inc indeed talk persisted last week that japanese investors are planning to re weight their portfolios in favour of the higher yielding markets at the start of japan s new fiscal year on april and while traditionally the japanese have not been big buyers of the shorter dated issues on offer at this week s u s auctions such reports undermine market confidence even actions by the british australian and canadian monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond markets the salomon brothers economists said meanwhile ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the u s market unless they deviate widely from expectations economists said this week s economic calendar begins on tuesday with february durable goods orders economists expect a rebound from january s depressed levels peter greenbaum of smith barney harris upham and co said several areas including transport equipment should have

last month while food prices declined meanwhile economists warned that the federal funds rate will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the approach of quarter end and the mid april tax

markets can adapt foreign currency futures markets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countries agreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band said leo melamed chairman of the chicago mercantile exchange s cme executive committee the target zone would not affect our market i think at all a pct range in the deutsche mark gives us a healthy market melamed told s in an interview we were willing to live in the old smithsonian era with a four pct shift he said referring to permitted currency fluctuations in the early s one thing you can adjust is to make each contract a larger value as chairman of the cme in melamed was instrumental in the development of currency futures which now are crucial to the chicago exchange melamed said capital flows which he estimated can approach billion dlrs a day would overwhelm efforts by governments to control currency fluctuations they can do it for a day in terms of intervention an hour a week maybe but not over a period of time so it s unrealistic and it doesn t work and it s unnecessary the cme s top policymaker also said a decision by the exchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock index futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would help eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity markets on so called triple witching day we think that the settlement in the morning will have a salutary effect so that over a longer period of time i think this issue triple witching will go away because of the change in the structure as of next june when the move is scheduled to go into effect he said melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by traders of the popular standard and poor s stock index future would address complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading two weeks ago the cme board of directors proposed barring brokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own account the board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in dual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades to the nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups the changes will in time have an extremely positive effect on the marketplace that s going to prove very very instrumental in increasing volume over time he said predicting the increase would come within a year melamed also chairman of dellsher investment co inc said the cme last week withdrew a proposal to put a point limit on the s and p index s daily price movement when the commodity futures trading commission told the exchange it could not be a temporary program the cme also received many negative comments many more than we anticipated melamed conceded many futures commission merchants predicted sell orders would accelerate in the event the price approached the bottom limit  u k profitted from autumn intervention lawson britain has reaped profits by using a stronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government last autumn to support sterling during a currency crisis chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said he said in a parliamentary debate i can now tell the house of commons that the dollars that were sold from the reserves in september and october have subsequently all been repurchased at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressures then for a two percentage point interest rate rise he said the increase in base rates was instead limited then to one point during a debate on the british budget which lawson unveiled last week he said that during the period of foreign exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat inconclusive group of five and group of seven meetings at the end of september i authorised the bank of england to intervene unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather than the two pct the market was then pressing for he said that that one percentage point increase effected in october had been reversed by this month s two half point cuts in banks base lending rates they are now at pct treasury figures show that the underlying change in british reserves seen as a guide to possible bank of england

imf demand for devaluation sudan has rejected a demand by the international monetary fund for a currency devaluation because such a move would have a negative impact on its economy the official sudan news agency suna reported finance minister beshir omer quoted by suna said his government also rejected an imf demand to lift state subsidies on basic consumer goods suna monitored by the british broadcasting corporation said omer made the remarks after a meeting in khartoum yesterday with imf envoy abdel shakour shaalan sudan burdened by a foreign debt of billion dlrs is some mln dlrs in arrears to the imf which declared it ineligible for fresh loans in february last year in february sudan announced a pct devaluation of its pound against the dollar adjusting the official exchange rate to pounds to the u s currency since then it has resisted pressure from main creditors for more currency adjustments arguing that past devaluations had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers dealers in khartoum s thriving black market said the dollar was sold at pounds today with stringent import regulations and the government increasingly short of foreign currency black market dollars are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring countries mainly egypt kenya ethiopia and zaire western diplomats in khartoum say the meetings between imf and sudanese government officials do not amount to formal talks but rather an effort by the imf to monitor sudan s economic performance the diplomats said sudan hoped a planned four year economic recovery program would be acceptable to the imf as a serious attempt to tackle the country s economic troubles and persuade its gulf arab creditors to pay the imf arrears this they said could provide sudan with a clean bill of health from the imf that it could take to western government creditors grouped informally in the so called paris club to reschedule debt payments twenty three pct of sudan s total foreign debt is owed to members of the paris club the diplomats said sudan s finance minister said last month the country s imf representative had told him the fund s executive board was very pleased with the mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past couple of months the representative omer said said imf managing director michel camdessus said he would ask saudi arabia to which sudan owes about billion dlrs to help khartoum to pay more sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly mln dlrs but set aside only some mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next june  fed governor supports commodity price guide robert heller a member of the board of governors of the federal reserve system said commodity prices could form a useful guide for setting domestic and international monetary policy speaking to the conservative heritage foundation heller said a broadly based commodity price index may be worth exploring as a guide to monetary policy in times of rising commodity prices monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices monetary policy might be eased he said commodities are also standardized to avoid measurement problems and occur at the beginning of production so as to give early warning signs of wholesale and retail changes there is no need to react to every small fluctuation in commodity prices or to do so on a daily basis heller said in a prepared text but if commodity prices exhibit a broad trend a policy action might be considered he said heller said using a broad based commodity price index as an indicator for monetary policy would also contribute to stabilized currency exchange rates commodity prices are generally uniform worldwide and prices for them are more consistent than for other types of goods he said he said other beneficial effects would be to stabilize export commodity prices for developing countries by using a commodity basket as a guidepost for monetary policy  baldrige says changes needed in exchange rates of currencies pegged to dollar current exchange rates almost within levels agreed by

willing to cooperate to stabilize exchange rates baker says u s wants to stabilize exchange rates treasury secretary james baker said the united states and other nations were willing to cooperate to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the levels that existed at the time of an international agreement last month our position with respect to the dollar goes back to the paris agreement that the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic conditions baker told a senate committee baker continued we said further that we and others are willing to cooperate closely to foster stability in exchange rates around those levels he referred to a february agreement by six leading industrial nations to cooperate on monetary matters baker refused to answer a question whether japan and germany had done enough to stimulate their domestic economies for the united states to support the dollar i will not comment because the foreign exchange market reads more or less than is intended in my statements baker said baker said that the other signatories recognized that they must carry their share of the load of correcting external imbalances that have hindered the world s economy he cited news reports that germany would increase a proposed tax cut for by about five billion marks to stimulate domestic growth japan also agreed to consider stimulative measures after the japanese budget was made final baker said those nations were stimulating their economies in a manner consistent with gains against inflation  exchange rate bill clears u s house panel the house banking committee adopted legislation to direct the u s treasury to begin negotiations aimed at seeking regular adjustment of exchange rates by countries such as taiwan and south korea whose currencies are pegged to the value of the u s dollar the measure was adopted as part of a wide ranging trade bill that will be considered by the full house in april before it moves onto the senate the

foster exchange rate stability around current levels i would refer you to the paris agreement which was a recognition the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals baker told the cable news network in an interview we were quite satisfied with the agreement in paris otherwise we would not have been a party too it he said baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to co operate to foster greater exchange rate stability around those levels he refused to comment directly on the current yen dollar rate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recently tended to draw unwarranted inferences from what i say baker was quoted on british television over the weekend as saying he has no target for the u s currency a statement that triggered this week s renewed decline of the dollar i think the paris agreement represents evidence that international economic policy co ordination is alive and well baker said the treasury secretary stressed however it was very important for the main surplus countries to grow as fast as they could consistent with low inflation to resolve trade imbalances he added that federal reserve board chairman paul volcker has also been very outspoken in suggesting main trading partners grow as fast as they can baker noted that the j curve the delayed beneficial effect of a weakening of a currency on that country s trade balance takes to months to work its way through to the trade deficit and it is now months since the plaza agreement to lower the dollar s value he also said improvements in the trade deficit should come from other sources besides the exchange rate and pointed out the administration s package to improve u s competitiveness was now before congress  sumita says major nations will continue to cooperate to stabilize currencies miyazawa says major nations acting on paris accord finance minister kiichi miyazawa said major nations are taking action to stabilise exchange rates in line with

the six agreed to cooperate to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels miyazawa said he wishes to attend a meeting of seven major nations g expected just before the imf world bank interim committee meeting in washington starting on april the sources quoted miyazawa as saying japan is trying to prevent a further rise of the yen japan is taking the matter seriously he added asked if the six nations had agreed to stabilise the dollar at about yen the rate prevailing at the time of the paris talks miyazawa declined to give specific figures and said any mention of specific rates would

credibility this week as the dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers and widespread central bank intervention dealers said the dollar s fall below yen which follows last month s paris currency stabilisation agreement by the u s japan west germany britain france and canada is a dramatic reversal of the success of the group of five g new york plaza meeting to weaken the dollar they said the g and the market agreed in that the dollar was overvalued but this time the market and the authorities are on different sides dealers said apparent confusion in the ranks of the g nations has encouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite concerted intervention by the central banks of the united states japan britain and west germany they said pleas by japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa for action to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by comments by u s treasury secretary james baker that there was no target zone for the dollar the dollar was sold anyway yesterday s comment by baker that he stood by the paris accord did nothing to reverse sentiment dealers said the intervention backed by remarks by fed chairman paul volcker and japanese central bank governor satoshi sumita which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a halt has done little but slow the rate of its decline they noted the situation has again raised the question of whether intervention can succeed against the trend in today s huge currency markets dealers said the market s cool response to intervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars this means that the current dollar selling is not of a sheer speculative nature but backed by real demand said koichi miyazaki deputy general manager at sanwa bank dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the intervention and it is only a matter of time before some operators try to push it below yen the dollar closed in tokyo today at against new york s its record low was in tokyo last tuesday dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to rise above yen toward early april when the group of seven industrial nations meets to discuss currencies again the market expects the seven nations the paris six plus italy to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies apart from intervention a chief dealer at a u s bank said dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be used and they are sceptical anyway about how long the paris accord nations particulary the u s will remain willing to prevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high u s trade deficit especially with japan further pressure from a protectionist u s congress for a lower dollar is also limiting washington s options they said the market now thinks the central bank action is to slow the dollar fall not to push it back over yen said tadahiko nashimoto manager at long term credit bank of japan another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large forward dollar sales from april to june for export bills falling due for japanese exporters from april to september the exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen depreciation dealers said yesterday s request to trading houses by the ministry of international trade and industry to restrict dollar sales looks ineffective in light of this real demand they said the market is also anticipating active institutional dollar sales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new business year starting april dealers said the market seems to have established a new dollar trading range between and yen one dealer said the dollar traded between and yen after the paris accord on february and yen was then considered the low end for the dollar against the yen he said some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below yen it

in late help to the money market bringing the total assistance today to mln stg this compares with the bank s revised estimate of a mln stg money market shortfall  mulford says g wants stability treasury assistant secretary david mulford said the paris agreement among leading industrial nations is intended to produce reasonable stability in exchange markets over the next few months he told a senate banking subcommittee the group of five nations and canada agreed in paris to see if there can t be a period of reasonable stability instead of volatility to give time for the committments in paris to take place asked by sen phil gramm r tex whether u s intervention was not in fact overvaluing the dollar mulford replied that the administration judged that after economic adjustments current exchange rates reflect underlying economic fundamentals in particular the stability sought by the nations would allow west germany and japan to stimulate their economies domestically and the u s to cut its budget deficit mulford said in his testimony he stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar would hurt the ability of germany and japan to boost growth mulford noted that half of west germany s economy was affected by international developments he also said increased japanese domestic growth would result in more u s exports to japan and would not necessarily lead to greater japanese capital flows to the u s as gramm asserted if japan reformed its domestic capital market commenting on the paris agreement mulford said i think exchange rates ought to be stabilized so germany s and japan s efforts can be carried out mulford rejected gramm s argument that faster domestic growth in germany and japan would result in an even lower dollar mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a pattern of higher growth overseas as a way of improving the u s trade deficit otherwise he said the trade deficit would be resolved either through a much lower dollar or a u s recession both alternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable  mulford disappointed in newly industrialized nics efforts to strengthen currencies german wage round said to limit monetary options the bundesbank s options for west germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and employers economists and money market dealers said call money fell in quite active trading today dropping to pct from pct yesterday and below the pct treasury bill rate as a difficult month end approached but dealers and economists said the bundesbank was unlikely to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for fear of upsetting the current wage round one money market dealer for a major foreign bank said i don t think the bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever happens but it also does not want them to fall above all it wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes in west germany unions and employers prepare the ground for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments of growth and inflation economists said ute geipel economist with citibank ag said if the bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the medium term unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands as a result the bundesbank was concerned to make no move that would interfere in the negotiating process geipel said in the current round the country s most powerful union the ig metall representing metalworkers and engineers is demanding a shortening of the working week to hours from the present and an accompanying five pct increase in wages the engineering employers association gesamtmetall is offering to bring in a hour week from july and give a two stage wage increase a pct rise from april this year and another pct from july the agreement forged by ig metall europe s largest union with mln members and the employers would set the benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the public sector banks and federal post office negotiations began in december and unions are hopeful they may conclude by early april ahead of the traditional holiday period in june though many economists said the unions current warning strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and would not lead to a repeat of s damaging seven week strikes others said unions would not compromise greatly on their positions and there could still be conflict this could extend the length of time in which the bundesbank would keep its activity low key economists said the money market head said the unions humiliation by the protracted financial problems of the neue heimat cooperative housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy the unions haven t forgotten that and they will put this squarely onto the account in the negotiations he said in addition the newly elected chairman of the ig metall union franz steinkuehler was more radical and determined than his predecessor hans meyer and may be set for a longer battle to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership more than engineering workers at firms mainly in south germany held warning strikes lasting up to two hours yesterday firms hit included zahnradfabrik passau gmbh and aerospace group messerschmitt boelkow blohm gmbh today employees from companies came out in warning strikes a statement from ig metall said money market dealers said that overnight call money rates would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on a politically inhibited bundesbank about eight billion marks were coming into the market tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government as a result some banks fell back on the bundesbank s offer to mop up liquidity via the sale of three day treasury bills anticipating still lower rates before the month end but a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers was due on monday other dealers noted if banks were short of liquidity until the bills matured on tuesday rates could soar perhaps to the pct lombard ceiling banks were well stocked up with funds having an average billion marks in bundesbank minimum reserves in the first days of march well above the billion requirement  british french ministers discuss public spending french finance minister edouard balladur discussed the need to control public spending in talks here today with british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson a treasury spokesman said the spokesman said the ministers reviewed their economies and public spending domestic and european community wide he declined to comment on whether the subject of concerted action to shore up the dollar had arisen the u s currency dipped sharply earlier this week after a month of relative stability after an agreement by six major industrialised nations in paris on february to stabilise their currencies  volcker reaffirms g negotiating process washington march federal reserve board chairman paul volcker urged congress to allow the government to continue its flexible negotiations on exchange rates through procedures such as the recent paris meeting of industrialized countries in a letter to house banking committee chairman fernand st germain volcker said he opposed legislation to formalize international negotiations on exchange rates and to require treasury secretary james baker to disclose plans for currency intervention volcker s letter was written march in advance of the committee s march approval of the proposed legislation the fundamental policy objectives of the united states can best be implemented in a more flexible framework such as through the recent meeting in paris of finance ministers and central bank governors volcker said he recommended congress not lock the administration into formal procedures for international exchange rate negotiations to achieve specific exchange rate goals the achievement of a sustainable pattern of u s international transactions and more stability in exchange rates are ones with which i remain sympathetic he said the banking committee s bill directs the administration to to start negotiations to reach a competitive exchange rate for the u s dollar runs the risk of build up potentially destabilizing market expectations volcker said a requirement that baker disclose his intervention policy could reduce the usefulness of intervention as a tool to deal with exchange rate volatility volcker added baker has also opposed the legislation which will be wrapped into a major trade bill for consideration in the house in late april the senate will consider its version of the trade bill in may  former herstatt dealer can be sued court rules the former

premier yu kuo hua ordered financial officials to quicken the pace of relaxing foreign exchange controls and study the possibility of suspending the controls a cabinet statement said the statement quoted yu as telling finance ministy and central bank officials the relaxation was needed to help reduce taiwan s surging foreign exchange reserves which reached a record billion u s dollars this month finance minister robert chien told reporters his ministry and the central bank would work jointly on new measures to ease the controls but he did not give details yu said the government could maintain the framework of the foreign exchange controls while finding ways to ease them the controls would be used during emergency taiwan s reserves have resulted largely from its trade surplus which hit billion dlrs in and billion in about pct of the surplus was from taiwan s trade with the united states according to official figures but he said that while easing the controls would help reduce the reserves it would not do so substantially in a short time economists and bankers said the new decision resulted from growing pressure from the united states taiwan s largest trading partner which buys almost half the island s exports lu ming jen economic professor at soochow university told s the decision came a little bit late but it was better than never ko fei lo vice president at first

establishment of an arab fund to assist the lebanese pound which has lost more than pct of its value against the dollar since january bouldikian told an arab exchange dealers conference the bank would continue to take measures to defend the currency but he said lebanon needed foreign support for its war battered economy now more than ever before we expect a common effort between the central bank and arab central banks and monetary authorities to create an arab fund to support and preserve the value of the currency when needed he said twelve years of civil war have devastated productive sectors of the lebanese economy and created gaping trade and budget deficits bouldikian said recent government measures had succeeded in reducing demand for imports and increasing exports these are encouraging factors but the war has not ended yet he said we believe that with a just political solution acceptable to all sides confidence will return and this will benefit the lebanese pound and lebanon in the meantime he said the central bank had four main goals to use surplus liquidity to finance the budget deficit to increase the role of commercial banks and non bank financing institutions in financing the deficit to limit the transfer of lebanese pounds into foreign currency deposits to protect the financial health of commercial banks  china postpones plan to scrap parallel currency
