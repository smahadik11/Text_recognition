pct drop in first quarter earnings said it expects to report improved results in future earnings periods healthy consumer credit growth record fee based income highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading and a solid capital position combined with the restraint of non interest expenses should lead to improved results in the periods ahead chairman allan taylor said in a statement the bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter ended january fell to mln dlrs from mln dlrs a year ago taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank s international operations remains weak reflecting resource related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities the bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to mln dlrs in the first quarter from mln dlrs a year ago while earnings from international operations plunged to mln dlrs from mln dlrs last year royal bank said first quarter international net interest income declined from last year reflecting reduced revenues from international investment banking as well as a significant loss on disposal of its affiliate in trinidad and tobago other income rose to mln dlrs from mln dlrs last year the rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail deposit service fees and higher foreign exchange revenue but lower securities commissions from international investment bank operations partly offset the gains royal bank said the bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in consumer lending particularly residential mortgages  kay corp kay th qtr net oper shr cts vs dlrs oper net vs revs mln vs mln year oper shr dlrs vs

profits into because of a new contract worth mln dlrs wall street analysts said previously it was expected the business would peak and decline at some point in the next five years the improved outlook results from amr corp s amr decision to order new planes powered by cf c ge engines creative financial footwork helped ge get the order said nicholas heymann analyst at drexel burnham lambert inc amr declined to go into detail on financing arrangements for its order of boeing co ba and airbus industrie twinjet long distance aircraft but amr said it was using rent a plane leases that allow it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt structure amr also has the right to decline delivery of the planes or return them on short notice the arrangement protects amr in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe downturn in the economy from ge s point of view the package looks like a good deal for several reasons heymann said ge will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of delivery heymann noted and if for some reason amr decides not to take the planes ge s financial arm general electric financial services inc would have little trouble rounding up another airline that wanted the fuel efficient planes on the whole the deal appears to pose little risk for ge heymann said ge s stock declined to on shares by midafternoon h p smith analyst at smith barney harris upham and co said for a billion dlr revenue company no one order will have much of an effect on the stock russell leavitt analyst at salomon brothers inc said the order will help to maintain a

from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last year with well over half of the business in the military sector according to analysts estimates the rosy outlook for ge s jet engine business coincides with an upbeat performance in other segments heymann expects ge to earn dlrs per share in the first quarter of saying many will be suprised by the results he believes ge has shown through its acquisition of rca corp that it has a unique ability to buy a major business and reshape it pruning some parts and recombining parts with other elements of its business areas smith sees ge earning

development phase of government contracts should not have a major impact on rockwell s near term performance he noted however the increasing focus on cost sharing could limit technological innovation i worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of contracting approaches too early in the development stages of important military contracts beall said adding long term we have a very serious

wall street after a share buyback program announced yesterday but analysts said gm s future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share gm shares rose to in active trading analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker s long term prospects i m very positive on gm said jack kirnan of kidder peabody and co they re clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value however some analysts worry about how gm will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share after the market had closed yesterday gm said it would buy back pct of its common stock by the end of the announcement sent investors today scrambling for gm shares with more than mln shares changing hands by mid day the buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning and at least one increased his earnings estimates for gm based on a good performance expected from new car models but david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc said the repurchase program is not a positive the buyback doesn t really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet he said since gm will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases the stock should settle back down to around he added healy projects gm will earn five dlrs a share in and dlrs in compared to earnings of dlrs healy s numbers are near the low end of wall street estimates which range from five dlrs to dlrs in and from four dlrs to dlrs in like other analysts healy sees gm s share of the domestic car and truck market falling in on balance gm cars are not selling as well as their competitors he said in late february gm car sales fell pct from the year ago period while competitors ford motor co f and chrysler corp c both posted increases but gm said february sales showed improvement over january adding that it expects improvement in coming months overall gm s share of u s car and truck sales should fall to around or pct in from pct at the end of analysts said the numbers include imports kidder peabody s kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter which will help gm finance the buyback gm stock has been a real laggard and now it s rolling up its sleeves and getting serious i think there s a major earnings surprise in the winds he said kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today in part in reaction to the announced buyback and sees gm earning dlrs this year and dlrs in the company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to ford and chrysler he said another positive for the stock is gm s dividend currently five dlrs a share annually which gives it a higher yield than its competitors kirnan said and gm will raise the cash dividend to cts a share next year he predicted but analyst michael lucky of shearson lehman brothers inc said u s car sales will weaken and gm s new products if successful will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share i believe their new cars will be successful but that will only curtail losses in market share which will fall to around pct by lucky said philip fricke of goldman sachs and co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears while he is recommending gm stock he said results will not improve until i m not looking for improvement this year this is a transition year for gm he said fricke who estimates earnings at dlrs and at dlrs said cost cutting and new car models will not affect results but the key thing isn t so much what they earn this year it s the momentum beyond this year that s important  goldome fsb year net net mln vs mln note

last year taking account of that depreciation as well as currency fluctuations was billion francs after a billion loss in in crd s sales fell pct to mln tonnes from mln due to the growth in imports by

told analysts that the company faced some regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its pacific bell operating company in rates hearings before the california public utility commission guinn said the company faced a potential mln dlr revenue reduction and due to ongoing discussions with the commission he said the figure might even be greater the company also faces some opposition to a mln dlr rate hike requested for guinn said the commission found mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations and assumptions while mln dlrs might represented unneeded modernization costs guinn also said that the company is still studying whether to join an international consortium that plans to lay a transpacific telephone cable between the u s and japan we have not agreed to anything guinn said but added he would soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the company would make a decision soon on participating asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the u s department of justice which would allow the bell operating companies to offer limited long distance services guinn said the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion long distance services is a very competitive business it s a commodity business and becoming more so he said i m not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that business however guinn generally applauded the u s recommendations saying they would give more latitude for the bell operating companies to expand into non regulated businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic alliances with other companies he added that while the company welcomes the expansion into new areas it is not currently involved in any acqusition talks we do not have anything actively under consideration he
