u s grain carloadings fall in week u s grain carloadings totaled cars in the week ended february down pct from the previous week but pct above the corresponding week a year ago the association of american railroads reported grain mill product loadings in the week totalled cars down pct from the previous week but pct above the same week a year earlier the association said gao likely to show certs more costly than cash a study on grain certificates due out shortly from the government accounting office gao could show that certificates cost the government to pct more than cash outlays administration and industry sources said analysis that the gao has obtained from the agriculture department and the office of management and budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments a gao official told reuters gao is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of sen jesse helms r n c former chairman of the senate agriculture committee the report which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash is scheduled to be released in mid march the cost of certificates said the gao source depends on the program s impact on the usda loan program if gao determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures then the net cost of the program would go up however if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease the cost effect of certificates would be less gao will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded the gao official said but a negative report on certificates will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program an agricultural consultant said the omb is said to be against any expansion of the program while usda remains firmly committed to it soviet grains seen entering spring on shaky note soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter weather and crop analysts said prospects for another near record grain harvest in the soviet union appear dim at this point but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems analysts said but the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the soviet grain supply and future buying plans analysts of the soviet union said from a weather standpoint you can say with certainty that the soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop than last year gail martell chief meteorologist for e f hutton said the next six weeks in the ussr s grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops martell and other analysts said where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us an agriculture department authority on the ussr said the soviet union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill this would be equal to about pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years the usda analyst said with a timely spring soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops sometimes as much as pct lower normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures this winter however snowcover in soviet grain areas has generally been excellent so the bulk of winterkill analysts speculate likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination fall dryness may be a problem there s a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness martell said precipitation last fall was as little as pct of normal in southern and northern ukraine and below normal over the entire winter crop area she said recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice crusting and winterkill jim candor senior forecaster for accu weather said livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter analysts said the dry fall damaged pastures the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off pasture feeding they said the soviets are not in a desperate situation they don t have to buy grains now a usda official said but if the soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year s huge crop of mln tonnes was a one time fluke brought on by perfect conditions more soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies he said bad weather during the next six weeks could push the soviets back into the market weather analysts said a lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half martell said u s congress to look at soil program exemptions the senate agriculture committee is expected to take up a bill tomorrow that would exempt from government conservation regulations those farmers who have rotated alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes with row crops committee staff said under current so called sodbuster law farmers who planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes on highly erodible land in the years through lose federal farm program benefits if they produce a row crop on that land in later years sen edward zorinsky d neb sponsor of the measure said recently that those crop rotating practices resulted in less erosion than the practices of many farmers who produced strictly row crops izvestia says soviet winter crops need reseeding the government daily izvestia said a considerable amount of soviet winter crops need to be reseeded and the state grain harvest target of mln tonnes will not be easy to fulfil without giving figures the newspaper said a considerable part of the winter crops must be reseeded but that creates extra effort in the fields in spring the soviet union has previously said nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill a u s department of agriculture analyst in washington has said the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in years the planned task of bringing in no less than mln tonnes of grain is not simple izvestia said this week s sudden fall in temperatures has affected large parts of the country and has caused fieldwork to stop in the ukraine it said adding that temperatures fell to as low as minus centigrade in byelorussia u s senate panel makes conservation exemption the u s senate agriculture committee approved a measure that would exempt farmers who planted alfalfa or other multiyear grasses and legumes between and from a federal conservation requirement sen edward zorinsky d neb said his bill would restore equity under federal sodbuster rules which currently deny farm program benefits to farmers who between and planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes without interrupting the plantings with a row crop an official from a leading conservation group who asked not to be identified said the panel s move was an unfortunate first action because it could lead to the exemption of potentially millions of acres from the sod buster regulations established under the farm bill renewal of u s ussr grain pact said uncertain prospects for renewal of the five year u s ussr grains agreement are uncertain at this point a soviet trade official told reuters the current trade imbalance between the united states and the soviet union high u s commodity prices and increased world grain production make a renewal of the supply agreement next year less certain albert melnikov deputy trade representative of the soviet union said in an interview the current agreement expires on sept melnikov said that world grain markets are different than when the first agreement was signed in statements from both u s and soviet officials have indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as attractive for both sides as it once was we have had one agreement we have had a second agreement but with the second agreement we ve had difficulties with prices melnikov said i cannot give you any forecasts in response to the future about the agreement i do not want to speculate on what will happen after sept he said melnikov noted that he has seen no indications from soviet government officials that they would be pushing for a renewal of the agreement the situation is different in comparison to three five or ten years ago we can produce more he said u s cabinet council set to mull farm issues the reagan administration s cabinet level economic policy council is scheduled to meet friday to discuss among other issues the status of agricultural legislation administration officials said the officials said discussion of a u s agriculture department wheat export subsidy to the soviet union was not on the agenda matters not on the agenda however can be brought before the council the officials said grain trade officials have speculated that usda would make a wheat export enhancement offer to moscow but usda officials have said the matter is not under active consideration usda today transmitted to congress a package of legislative proposals including bills that would cut target prices and speed up loan rate reductions usda estimates ussr grain imports mln tonnes vs in feb in usda estimates soviet grain crop at mln tonnes vs in feb year ago cbt discusses major changes for renovation chicago board of trade cbt agricultural and financial futures markets could be in for a period of major upheaval later this year if the exchange goes ahead with planned renovation a cbt spokesman told reuters the exchange was looking at a number of options to identify the most cost effective and efficient way to proceed including one which would involve moving the entire grains floor out of the building and into the nearby midamerica commodity exchange one of cbt chairman karsten mahlmann s agenda items has been to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room the spokesman said another cbt official executive vice president george sladoje said the issue would be discussed this friday at a special meeting on the exchange floor a number of presentations have been made with regard to renovating the financial futures room sladoje said we ve looked at five or six different alternatives involving such things as flip flopping the trading rooms he added it is conceivable that under a couple of these plans we might use the midamerica exchange temporarily for some cbt markets sladoje said if we move out of one floor entirely then the construction period will be about a year he said adding that the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then be on the drawing board for eight months to a year the cbt spokesman stressed that discussions were very preliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin until this summer at the earliest in order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary home next door in the present grains dominated area this could involve moving cbt markets in u s treasury bond futures treasury notes muni bonds and options on t bonds and t notes through an adjoining corridor while utilizing the midamerica floor for such cbt futures contracts as corn wheat soybeans soybean products and agricultural options any such moves could meet with opposition among some cbt members one senior floor trader said the financial futures room badly needs renovating there is talk the grains floor will shift to the midam and the financials will move to the grains area he said the cbt spokesman said another option being discussed was to renovate the financial floor in quadrants one quarter at a time the first step after deciding the most effective way to proceed would be to get architectural and engineering drawings he said he added that it was difficult at present to determine an exact time frame for any possible moves this is a major undertaking and a process that would spread out over next year he said floor traders at the midamerica commodity exchange which merged with the cbt about a year ago said they were preparing to vacate their floor at the end of this month space has recently been cleared for them at the cbt by moving its major market index pit into the area once reserved for lightly traded cbt gold and silver futures which now share their trading area the midam specializes in mini contracts in grains livestock metals financials and foreign currencies as well as some options contracts rumor has it that the cbt grains are coming over here because the bonds are too crowded one midam trader said another source at the midam said this change could take place by july or august cargill official defends certificate programs the use of generic in kind commodity certificates has helped ease storage problems and is a necessary part of export promotion programs a senior executive for the world s largest grain company said testifying before the house agriculture subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feedgrains robbin johnson vice president of cargill inc disputed claims that u s grain companies have made huge profits from certificate trading the certs program is not in any way a windfall to the trade he said johnson said that cargill has been dealing with a two pct spread in certificate transactions and that this is within the normal grain marketing levels johnson recognized current concern over the cost of certificates as compared to cash but said that critics need to look more closely at the savings caused by certs noting for example that widespread use of certs in the pik and roll marketing technique last summer helped ease storage costs certificates are also an important part of any export promotion program he said the more you look at ways to expand export markets the more you have to look at ways to expand certs to put more grain into the market to meet demand he said subcommittee chairman dan glickman d kans said his committee would be looking at the certificate program later this year and studying the general accounting office report on certificate costs china s january grain exports fall china s grain exports in january totaled tonnes down pct from january customs figures show they gave no detailed breakdown the official china economic news quoted the figures as showing tea exports rose pct to tonnes during the month imports of wool rose pct to tonnes over the same period the figures show lyng says too late for crop decoupling this year u s agriculture secretary richard lyng said it is too late to implement a full acreage provision or decoupling for grain crops i think there s a chance we ll see that legislation passed but not for crops it s too late lyng told the national grain and feed association convention here lyng added that there seems some support in congress for and there was a good chance a pilot program will be passed as part of a pending disaster bill but he indicated that it is already too late in the year to alter the crop program sign up for spring crops closes the end of this month overall lyng predicted very little change will be legislated in the farm bill this year eep should be used tactically yeutter says u s trade representative clayton yeutter said the export enhancement program eep should be used as a tactical tool and not as a general policy yeutter made the comment in response to a question whether the u s should expand the eep to cover grain sales to the soviet union he did not comment directly on the soviet question replying that any decision would be made at the highest levels of the reagan administration and i don t want to preempt that yeutter told the national grain and feed association eep should continue to be used as a tactical tool against the european community but not as a general policy he said selective eep use has been successful in pressuring the e c u s senator uncommitted on offering bill senator richard lugar of indiana ranking republican on the u s senate agriculture committee has not decided whether to introduce an administration backed bill to apply the so called provision to through grain crops an aide to the senator said the reagan administration has asked lugar to offer the measure the aide said however a number of farm groups have told lugar they oppose the proposal on the grounds it would reopen the farm bill and the senator has decided to take a second look at the proposal the aide said last week the aide indicated lugar was planning to offer the measure and a bill to tighten a payment limitation loophole china to import more grain in china s grain imports will rise in because of a serious drought and increasing demand but will be not be as large as in the past chinese officials and japanese traders told reuters they said foreign exchange constraints and national policy would not allow a return to large scale imports which peaked at mln tonnes in an agricultural official of the shanghai government put maximum imports at about mln tonnes this year against mln in and mln in officials said grain imports rose in because of a poor harvest and rising domestic demand but remained below exports which rose to mln tonnes from mln in china is short of foreign exchange the shanghai official said we cannot rely on imports even at current low world prices only if there is a major disaster will we become a major importer a japanese trader in peking said chinese grain imports would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and animal consumption at current prices china loses yuan on every tonne of grain it exports though it earns foreign exchange which it badly needs the trader said the people s daily said last saturday a serious drought is affecting mln hectares of arable land which will reduce the summer grain harvest from last year s level the paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying enough attention to agriculture especially grain making it difficult to achieve the grain output target of mln tonnes against mln in all areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest area especially of corn sweet potatoes paddy rice and high yield cash crops it said it added factory production might have to be reduced to provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight the drought since january the press has devoted much attention to grain stressing that growth in output is vital to china s economic and political stability and that prices paid to farmers are too low officials in east china have repeatedly said stable grain production is a key state policy and outlined the measures being taken in their areas to encourage output the shanghai official said that in one suburb pct of the pre tax profits of factories are used to subsidise agriculture he said rural industries in other suburbs also set aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the workers available to help farmers chu jinfeng an official of fengbing county outside shanghai said factory workers get yuan a month and three years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits pan huashan an official of the agricultural department of zhejiang province said rural industry also subsidises grain output in his province in addition we are setting up grain production bases raising the level of science and technology on the farms and improving the supply of raw materials roads and other infrastructure he said the shanghai official said rural residents who work in industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their spare time or let other family members farm it in some cases they lease the land to grain farmers the china daily said last month that grain output should reach between and mln tonnes by and between and mln by it said growing grain should be made profitable the advantages the state promises grain growers actually yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption only this will boost enthusiasm it said southeast china crops saved by heavy rain the heaviest rains for seven months are believed to have saved more than one mln hectares of drought threatened crops in southeast china the official new china news agency said this week s rains have alleviated drought conditions in guangdong province the agency said china has warned that this year s harvest will be affected by drought in many areas soviets said to see new floor for grain output the intensive technology concept for grain production has put a new floor under ussr grain production the u s agriculture department s officer in moscow said in a field report the report quoting a broadcast on radio moscow said that due to intensive technology grain production in a bad year will not fall below mln tonnes and in a good year grain production could reach mln tonnes the u s agriculture department currently forecasts this year s ussr crop at mln tonnes and if realized this would be the third year since that the soviet union s grain harvest has exceeded mln tonnes the largest crop since was mln tonnes harvested in according to usda data usda official sees billion dlrs certificates there will be seven to eight billion dlrs of generic certificates on the market by the end of harvest an agriculture department official said the commodity credit corp will depend heavily on certificates to relieve storage problems this year ralph klopfenstein deputy administrator for commodity operations usda told participants at the national grain and feed association s annual convention klopfenstein said that ccc will not be able to relocate grain in any significant amount this fall so certificates will be used in various programs to relieve storage tightness klopfenstein said certificates meet the goal of allowing prices to go below loan levels and providing usda with an inventory management tool usda asks tight insect rules for grain shipments the u s agriculture department is proposing tighter federal standards setting allowable limits on insect infestations in grain shipments the changes in the standards would include the following establishing equal tolerances for the number of live insects in shipments of food grains feed grains and oilseeds revising the definition of infested to give equal value to all insects injurious to grain establishing lower levels of infestations in the infested level would be set at three or more live insects per representative sample about grams in two or more insects and in the final infestattion level would be set at one or more live insects per representative sample revising the definition of sample grade by adding a limit of live or dead insects per sample revising the definition of sample grade for wheat by adding a limit of insect damaged kernels per grams of wheat the department asked for public comments on the proposals by april trade proposes new ec grain intervention rules the european community ec cereals trade lobby organisation coceral said it has written to ec farm commissioner frans andriessen to propose a new system for sales into intervention which it claims could save the ec budget money it proposes that applications for intervention be made through a certificate valid for execution three months later if during the three months the trader found a market elsewhere he could buy back the certificate on payment of a one pct premium coceral argues that this would restore the original function of intervention as a safety net and would end the present situation in which produce is often sold into intervention as a precaution china says possible good harvest despite drought china s summer grain harvest may be good despite a serious drought because the state council cabinet has spent one billion yuan on irrigation and other anti drought work a hong kong newspaper said wen hui bao said the drought which has affected shanxi hebei henan and shandong the most has eased with march rains in south china and march snowfall in the north and as some new irrigation projects have come into use if the drought does not worsen there is hope for a bumper harvest it quoted experts of the ministry of electric power as saying they gave no figures the summer grain harvest was a record mln tonnes up from mln in out of a total grain harvest of mln the target is mln portuguese grain agency ban to remain ec sources a ban by a portuguese court on the state buying agency epac taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders will remain unless it is reversed in portugal or challenged in the european court of justice european commission sources said they denied a statement yesterday by portuguese agriculture minister alvaro barreto that the commission had accepted that epac should be eligible saying it had taken no view in the matter under the terms of portugal s accession to the european community a grain import monopoly held by epac is being reduced by pct annually until all imports are liberalised in lisbon s civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that epac should not be allowed to take part as it had done in the past in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports no proof of more chernobyl grain damage diplomats western agricultural attaches in moscow said they had no evidence to substantiate rumours that last april s chernobyl nuclear disaster had a worse effect on soviet grain than first reported current soviet interest in chartering ships to carry grain from the u s helped prompt the rumours on world markets but the diplomats said they had seen no reports in the state press and heard no comments from officials to substantiate them the official media was initially slow in reporting the accident but under kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev s campaign for openness gradually gave more and more details land around the nuclear plant was contaminated to varying degrees some is now being used to grow industrial crops instead of grain ec member states cool on cereal plans european community ec member states have generally given a cool initial reaction to proposals by the european commission for cereal price changes and related measures in the coming season ec diplomats said they said that in meetings of the ec special committee on agriculture representatives of most member states had said the changes taken together would have too harsh an impact on farmers incomes only britain and the netherlands had shown willingness to accept the commission s overall package they said as well as cuts of over two pct in common prices for most cereals the commission proposes a limitation of intervention to the february to march period and reduced monthly increments in intervention prices ec farm ministers will have a first discussion of the proposals at a meeting beginning next monday illinois co op futures dissolution vote set the shareholders of illinois cooperative futures co the futures trading arm of many midwest farm cooperatives for more than years will vote wednesday on its possible dissolution the directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month citing falling volume and increasing costs sources close to the organization told reuters the pullout of growmark inc which holds more than pct of the capital stock led to the call for dissolution the possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership ironically it was growmark at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators that founded illinois cooperative futures on december but growmark became affiliated last year with archer daniels midland of decatur ill and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies adm growmark with that relationship growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative said tom mulligan president of the co op membership in the company which mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives has declined from in a notable loss was agriindustries of iowa which became affiliated with cargill inc illinois co op s other members include such regional cooperatives as indiana grain based in indianapolis goldkist of atlanta ga midstates in toledo ohio farmland industries in kansas city mo farmers commodities des moines and harvest states in minneapolis some observors said the demise of illinois cooperative futures co is a serious blow to the cooperative system instead of banding together the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways said the floor manager of one cash house at the chicago board of trade such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant he said don hanes vice president for communications with the national council of farm cooperatives said cooperatives exist today down from five years ago the period we ve gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch he said there s been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co ops one problem he said is the co ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export rather than exporting it themselves losing potential profits but exporting grain requires heavy investments and the multi million dollar loss posted six years ago by farmers export co a co op set up to export grains served to make folks gun shy hanes said mulligan said he believes the dissolution if it is approved is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in u s agricultural economics a grain dealer at one member co op said the futures arm was a convenience something that saved us a little bit of money its dissolution will force us to change our way of doing business we re sorry to see the co op go by the wayside he said but there are lot of people out there to do business with there are plenty of capable firms steven w cavanaugh vice president for grain marketing with indiana grain said he would prefer to trade futures through a chicago based cooperative in terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to individuals there would be economic savings he said but added the times change and with changing times come different opinions of what businesses ought to be around cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had nothing to do with its profitability i would guarantee you that this company is not in trouble it is a sound healthy organization in the year ended february the illinois cooperative reported income of mln dlrs and members equity or net worth of mln dlrs the annual report for the most recent year has not been filed under the cooperative system income from operations is returned as patronage refunds to the members income and refunds in the past five years have been declining in the year ended february the co op reported income of mln dlrs and patronage refunds of mln dlrs patronage refunds in the year ended february totalled mln dlrs you re dealing with substantially lower volume mulligan said lower volume translates into higher costs according to the company s annual report growmark owns pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common shares of illinois cooperative futures co mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital growmark is entitled to he said he could not determine the figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution equity is distributed according to each member s trading volume and as a result changes from year to year however mulligan said the company could continue to meet minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if growmark pulled out iwc ups soviet grain import estimate three mln tonnes to mln official dutch grain levy test case to start in april a large dutch animal feed compounder will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a test case on the way the ec grain co responsibility levy is applied a spokesman for dutch grain and feed trade association het comite told reuters het comite has been co ordinating national actions against alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and since december has lodged more than individual cases with the business appeal court in the hague the basic complaint is that the levy does not take account of currency cross rates of exchange and therefore compounders in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another country het comite has obtained a temporary agreement that companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy rather than paying a full guilder amount to the dutch grain commodity board the spokesman said het comite will provide financial and legal backing to the test case in the business administration court in the hague oral proceedings are to begin on april the spokesman said het comite finally selected the company for the test case from among the lodged because the bill the firm received from the commodity board for payment of the levy contained significant currency distortions and involved grain from a wide variety of origins the name of the company is not being made public the administration court is not expected to make a final ruling on the case in the near future the het comite spokesman said it was very likely it would refer questions to the appeal court in luxembourg and as a result it could easily be another nine to months before the matter is finally resolved meanwhile the actions by dutch animal feed compounders are putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the dutch government to follow through on earlier statements and seek a complete review in brussels of the way in which the levy is collected the spokesman said het comite as a member of fefac the association of european animal feed manufacturers is also a party to actions protesting the whole levy in the luxembourg appeal court report on export markets for u s grain delayed the u s agriculture department s report on export markets for u s grain scheudled for release today has been delayed until wednesday april a department spokeswoman said no reason was given for the delay in releasing the monthly report economic spotlight china must preserve farmland if we go on using up farmland as we have done since there will be none left in years to grow grain on xu jinfeng a middle aged official in fengbang village on the edge of shanghai sums up the dilemma china faces as it tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same time let them get richer by building factories and new homes china has to feed one quarter of the world s population but only one seventh of its land is arable sharp increases in farm output since turned china into a net grain exporter for the first time in and again in but the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them official figures show that china lost just under one pct of its arable land to other uses in and a slightly smaller amount last year it gained mln new mouths to feed during the two years we lost very little land prior to when the industrialisation began official xu said since then nearly all the families in the county have built new homes and many factories have gone up last year we lost land to a new railway line xu said but land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses she added the issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the peking leadership which announced earlier this month that china will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year the present situation of abusing occupying unlawfully wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious said an article in the official press explaining the new measures it has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland it said china has a large population and its land resources are badly deficient an official of the shanghai city government said county authorities could approve conversion of only hectares of arable land to other uses while anything more than that must be approved by the city government the peking government faces another major obstacle in its efforts to ensure china s people get enough grain to eat the prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low making it more profitable for them to grow other crops to offset this the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to buy the state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to china s mln city residents rural factories also subsidise grain output paying farmers bonuses to grow it some officials argue that the simplest solution to the problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices chen zuyuan communist party secretary of a village in the eastern province of zhejiang said the government listened too much to the demands of selfish city people and could raise city grain prices without any problem but the government has ruled out a price rise raising the price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social stability said a china daily editorial this month the shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the long term we must be very careful we have a very large population which is used to price stability and will object to price rises he said the problem is how to do it the shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with grain and consumed by city residents in addition the state faces the problem of inadequate investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular the official press has reported that farmers fear farm policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into building graves memorial halls for ancestors and homes under reforms introduced in the late s farmers sign contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land as the expiration date of the year contract is almost at the halfway mark farmers are beginning to worry about the future the china daily said in an editorial last month their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to use the land but not own it for most of the period of communist rule the land was organised into collectives where there was little room for individual initiative new measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency of government policies and make them interested in long term investment the newspaper said cereals mcas to be

its farm products market while encouraging further development of domestic agriculture a government report said the white paper on agriculture for the year ended march said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at the next round of general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt talks will help prepare japan to improve access agriculture ministry sources said the paper marked an easing in japan s tough position on agricultural imports which stressed the need for strict controls on some products to maintain self sufficiency in food japan now produces only pct of its annual grain needs down from pct some years ago official figures show the paper said japanese agriculture has been slow to improve productivity and demand supply imbalances the relative shortage of farmland in japan is mainly responsible for higher domestic prices it said the strong yen has meant lower input material prices but has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has worsened working conditions among part time farmers the paper said this could make it difficult to improve the industry s structure the paper said to solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices to more reasonable levels japan should try to restructure the the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it self supporting it said adm grain elevator explodes in burlington iowa a grain

on the use of the certificates amstutz said that the issuance of billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years could result in government outlays of up to mln dlrs however the use of certificates preclude the need for to mln dlrs in storage and handling costs resulting in net savings for the government of mln dlrs he said without the use of certificates amstutz said nearly the entire crop which had been put under loan would have been forfeited to the commodity credit corporation ccc in addition mln bushels of grain that have been redeemed from ccc inventory through certificate exchanges would have remained in the goverment inventory he said when asked to comment on a recent study by the general accounting office that concluded certificates result in a net cost to the government amstutz said gao underestimated the benefits and overstated the costs of the certificate program amstutz said while certificates encourage more loan entries they also encourage heavier loan redemptions rather than forfeitures gao underestimated this net loan activity amstutz said there is no question in the mind of the department of agriculture that these certificates have been very useful amstutz said immediate benefits of certificates include greater market liquidity improved market price competitiveness higher farm income and improved debt situation and decreased carrying costs he said certificates are an integral part of usda s long range market oriented farm policy he said amstutz told subcommittee chairman rep dan glickman d kans that usda is in the process of preparing an official response to the gao study on certificates and will submit it to the subcommittee when completed more u s grain certificates needed study says more generic grain certificates should be released onto the market in order for the u s certificate program to have its full effect on commodities according to a study by sparks commodities inc the agriculture department should make grain deficiency payments and paid land diversion payments in a two third certificate one third cash ratio through fiscal year carroll brunthaver president of sparks commodities told a house agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates thereafter government payments should be issued in roughly a split between cash and certificates brunthaver said the sparks study on certificates examined two possible scenarios through the growing season a zero certificate case where no certificate program was assumed and an alternative case labeled adequate certificate case in which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings the study showed that total grain use under the adequate certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario by pct usage would be markedly more in and when grain usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the zero certificate case by to pct for the five year period examined government expenditures under the adequate certificate case were billion dlrs or pct less than under the zero certificate case the sparks study said that billion dlrs or pct of those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs the study also estimated that government grain stocks under the adequate certificate case would be billion bushels below the zero certificate case at the end of the period examined the sparks study said that while certificates permit market prices to fall below loan levels these lower prices increase commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus cash ussr crop weather summary usda noaa gradual warming continued in most regions of western soviet union
