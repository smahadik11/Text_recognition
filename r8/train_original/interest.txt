bankers welcome spanish reserve requirement hike bankers welcomed the bank of spain s decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks saying it reflected the socialist government s determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity the central bank last night raised the requirement by one percentage point to pct from march saying that excess liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the bank which until now has relied on raising interest rates to choke off money supply growth i think it s a good measure a senior foreign banker said it s a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy it shows that the political will is very strong they know that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long run he added the head of another foreign bank said that only a month ago the bank of spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in reserve requirements preferring to pursue its strategy of raising interest rates but bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now around eight pct for overnight funds was attracting money from abroad strengthening the peseta and making spanish exports less competitive the government says industry s competitiveness is also being hit hard by inflation at pct last year the rate was way above that of spain s major trading partners in the european community which it joined a year ago to help meet this year s target of five pct it is insisting pay rises stay at that level setting the stage for clashes with trade unions who say they have made enough sacrifices demonstrations by workers students and farmers whose demands essentially involve more government spending have become an almost daily occurrence but prime minister felipe gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the money market too hard the bank of spain which only yesterday raised its key overnight call money rate to pct left it unchanged at today s auction the rate has been increased nine times since the start of the year when it was below pct bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months the measure will take effect tomorrow following the publication of the decree in today s official gazette bankers say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and inevitably push lending rates higher a companion measure reducing the proportion of funds which banks must invest in specific areas also takes effect tomorrow officials said when the cut was approved last month that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher interest rates reuter

german government needs seen raising bond yields increased federal government borrowing needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push yields in german public authority bonds higher this year bond market sources say at the moment we have a sideways movement in the short term rates but how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on foreigners one portfolio manager for a large securities investment house in frankfurt said the sources also said the government had already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs friday s loan stock was the third this year already the sources noted it carried a year maturity a coupon of six pct and price of to yield pct at issue this compared with the last issue which had a pct coupon priced at pct for a yield of pct but dealers said the terms were not enough to attract foreign investors and the federal government would have to push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size with the introduction of a four billion mark volume only starting last may one finance ministry economist said it isn t more it s just the size of each bond which has increased he added conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new debt until recently federal issues sold very strongly abroad with up to pct of some being placed with foreign investors with the recent stabilisation of the u s dollar however foreign investors have begun to back away from the market as hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish sources said the government has may have already stepped up its borrowing having raised more than billion marks the government made net borrowings of billion marks in but bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was billion the sources said this indicated a move by the government out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the more acceptable loan stock form although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large amount of issues maturing recently other factors including the government s tax reduction program would also reduce income next year the problem here will be the tax reform the portfolio manager said he added that the government s cut in its top income tax rate to pct from pct in would make it difficult for the government to reduce borrowings the sources said the government would fall far short of covering all of its billion marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the other the portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal government loan stocks so far this year it has also fallen back twice to raise a total billion marks through the issue of fixed rate medium term kassenobligation notes a finance ministry economist said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a net billion marks this year though many sources agreed they added that the trend would probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come into effect i would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would mean government borrowing will increase the manager said bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance with the bundesbank s public authority bond yield calculation falling to pct on friday from a week earlier but sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan stock was slack as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise against the mark the demand wasn t so good a dealer for a german bank in london said the dollar s recent slight appreciation against the mark even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds recently some dealers said reuter
