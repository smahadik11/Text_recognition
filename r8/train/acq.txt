four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff some analysts

fact that they re investing heavily in the future which goes heavily into the international arena said lewis that does not preclude acquisitions and divestitures along the way he said lewis said if american express reduced its exposure to the brokerage business by selling part of shearson its stock might better reflect other assets such as the travel related services business it could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage the value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the

piedmont pie situation trans world airlines inc complicated the bidding for piedmont aviation inc by offering either to buy piedmont suitor usair group or alternatively to merge with piedmont and usair piedmont s board was meeting today and wall street speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from norfolk southern corp and usair the twa offer was announced shortly after the piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin twa offered to buy usair for dlrs cash per share it also said it was the largest shareholder of usair and threatened to go directly to usair shareholders with an offer for pct of the stock at a lower price twa also said it believed its offer was a better deal for usair shareholders than an acquisition of piedmont but it said it alternatively would discuss a three way combination of the airlines market sources and analysts speculated that twa chairman carl icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into the takeover arena we re just wondering if he s not just trying to get twa into play there s speculation on the street he just wants to move onto somthing else said one arbitrager we think twa might just be putting up a trial balloon analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by usair but that the airline will probably reject it because the price is relatively low compared to other airline deals they also said icahn must prove his offer credible by revealing financing arrangements they need to show their commitment and their ability to finance i think it s a credible offer said timothy pettee a bear stearns analyst i think it s certainly on the low end of relative values of airline deals said pettee pettee estimated dlrs would be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers usair stock soared after twa made public its offer a spokesman for usair declined comment and said usair had not changed its offer for piedmont usair offered of buy pct of that airline s stock for dlrs cash per share and the balance for dlrs per share in usair stock usair closed up at on volume of mln shares piedmont which slipped to close at also remained silent on the twa action piedmont has an outstanding dlr cash per share offer from norfolk southern corp norfolk southern declined comment but said it stuck with its offer for piedmont norfolk owns about pct of piedmont and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover of piedmont some analysts said icahn may be trying to acquire usair to make his own airline a more attractive takeover target icahn i think had wanted to sell his airline and there were no takers i think the strategy might have called for making his investment more attractive one way to accomplish that specific objective is to go out and acquire other airlines said andrew kim of eberstadt fleming i don t know whose going to buy them but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package said kim but icahn s financing ability for such a transaction remains in doubt in part because of twa s heavy debt load wall street sources said twa has some cash with which to do the offer the sources said icahn has not lined up outside financial advisers and plans to make his own arrangements icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy usx corp x and still retains pct of that company s stock some wall street sources said the financier s usx plan was impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser drexel burnham lambert inc because of wall street s insider trading scandal industry sources also predicted usair might reject the twa offer on price and financing concerns it s littered with contingencies and it doesn t even have a financing arrangement said one executive at another major airline but the executive conceded a merged twa usair would be a strong contender with usair s east coast route system and planned west coast presence from psa usair could feed the intenrational flights of twa which has a midwest presence in its st louis hub adding piedmont dominant in the southeast to the mix would develop an even stronger force the combined entity would also have twa s pars reservation system such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would

hughes ht merger baker international corp said it has filed suit in state court in houston to compel hughes tool co to complete its proposed merger with baker late yesterday hughes said it had terminated the merger agreement because baker would not agree to an alternative divestiture plan devised by hughes hughes board had previously found unacceptable a u s justice department consent

decree hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the counting of votes on the deal baker said it believes the vote was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger baker said the new terms that hughes proposed for the merger as an alternative to the consent decree were more burdensome than those of the consent decree

units named in the consent decree it said its suit names as defendants hughes and certain of its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing hughes to live up to the merger agreement or

conditional nature and other terms of the twa offer the timing of the offer and the circumstances under which it was made usair group believes that the purpose of the twa offer is to interfere with

the usair group board views as most beneficial to usair group shareholders employees and passengers and which mr icahn obviously regards as contrary to his own personal interests usair said its board has authorized counsel to explore all appropriate legal remedies against what it called twa s last minute attempt to interfere with usair group s acquisition of piedmont the company said conditions to the twa offer include twa obtaining financing the usair board redeeming defensive rights issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the fair price provision contained in usair s charter

dlr oil field service company we re working very hard on this merger hughes board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for march to give baker more time to consider the counter proposal the hughes board which had previously expressed concern about a u s department of justice consent decree that would require baker to sell its drilling bit operations and submersible pump business met yesterday and threatened to terminate the proposed merger the hughes board made a counter proposal that the two companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses before signing the decree the directors of baker immediately after receiving the counter proposal filed a law suit in texas in a texas state court to force to hughes to complete the merger the uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might be imposed by the department of justice makes us very nervous about what the outcome might be kistler said in explaining why hughes had

keep its merger proposal on the table he declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit kistler said hughes would be willing to consider a compromise counter proposal but declined to be more specific the justice department in january said it would block the hughes and baker merger on anti trust grounds unless both companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide for the sale of the assets after the merger took place the hughes board said it would not sign the decree because its was too unreasonable hughes said that baker should instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the merger is finalized and given government approval under the decree if baker is unable to find acceptable buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is approved a federal trustee would become responsible for finding a buyer kistler said that under those terms the trustee could take up to years to complete the sales he also expressed concern that the combined

fate of piedmont aviation inc which was being courted by usair yesterday icahn s transworld airlines inc twa made a billion dlr offer for usair group the move complicated a usair takeover offer for piedmont which was believed to be close to accepting the bid today usair rejected icahn s dlr per share offer and said the bid was a last minute effort to interfere in its takeover of piedmont icahn was unavailable for comment piedmont fell one to on volume of twa was off to usair fell to as doubt spread it would be taken over analysts and market sources view the twa bid as an attempt to either trigger a counter offer from usair or to attract a suitor who might want both airlines once they merged the next move is either icahn starts a tender offer or piedmont and usair announce a deal speculated one arbitrager some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current price of piedmont since it is not clear that usair s bid will succeed piedmont s largest shareholder and other suitor norfolk southern corp nsc has offered dlrs per share for the company usair offered dlrs cash per share for half of piedmont stock and dlrs per share in stock for the balance some arbitragers however believe the depressed price of piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is destined to be acquired by someone usair they said is the least likely to be bought icahn who has long talked about further consolidation in the airline industry also offered usair the alternative of a three way airline combination including twa and piedmont but wall street has given little credibility to icahn s offer which lacked financing and was riddled with contingencies still he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two airlines both of which analysts said would fit well with twa you can t discount him said one arbitrager analysts however said icahn would have to prove he is serious by following through with his threats or making a new offer in making the offer for usair icahn threatened to go directly to shareholders for pct of the stock at a lower price if usair rejected his offer it s clear icahn wants to sell and he s bluffing said one arbitrager analysts said the dlr per share offer was underpriced by about six dlrs per share some analysts believe icahn s proposed three way airline combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles but others believe it could be cleared if the companies are acquired separately twa would have to be the surviving company for the deal to work said one analyst analysts said such a merger would be costly and complicated twa has the best cost structure since icahn succeeded in winning concessions from its unions in order for the other carriers to come down to twa s wage scale in a merger twa would have to be the surviving entity analysts said such a move does not necessarily free icahn of twa they said they said he showed skill in reducing ozark airlines costs when he merged it into twa last year and he might be a necessary ingredient for a merger to work however other analysts speculated the managements of piedmont and usair would not tolerate icahn as head of a new company they said a usair acquisition of twa might be a way for him to exit the company if usair s airline is then merged into twa  baker int l bko hopes to complete merger baker international corp treasurer eric mattson said the company

hughes statement that it is interested in a merger and baker s response that a merger is still possibile analysts said no one could be certain where the situation was going i think the merger is not going through said phil pace analyst at kidder peabody and co he said the merger lost a lot of its appeal when the u s department of justice required that baker sell off its reed tool co operation although the reed operation is relatively small in view of the total size of a combined baker hughes pace said to pct of the cost savings are tied up in that they hughes are obviously concerned about the lawsuit said james crandell analyst at salomon brothers inc apparently they are willing to continue discussions but whether they will alter their position i don t know it s getting a little confusing said james carroll analyst at painewebber group inc he said the arguments cited by hughes yesterday for not doing the merger tend to be weak hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it wanted reed tool and other businesses sold prior to april the projected merger date a government decree allowed a longer period of time hughes contended it was better to formally combine the companies with the status of reed already settled baker apparently sees no reason to speed up the sale carroll said baker had previously estimated to mln dlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling reed but he said baker now thinks to mln dlrs will be saved while hughes sees a saving of only to mln dlrs carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first signed the outlook for the industry has improved materially hughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry is lifting  armtek arm sells tire truck tire business armtek corp formerly known as armstrong
