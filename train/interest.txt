japan expected to cut base rate for state bodies japan is expected to cut the base lending rate for state financial institutions to pct from as part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in paris finance ministry sources said they said the cut is based on a revision of the trust fund bureau law which should be approved by parliament on march abolishing the pct minimum interest rate on deposits with the bureau the bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses they said the base lending rate for state bodies such as the japan development bank people s finance corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long term prime rates the sources said however it was impossible for them to follow the last cut to pct from pct on january because the trust fund bureau rate was legally set at pct the ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy they said on tuesday the ministry allowed long term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of pct effective february the move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau the postal savings system of the posts and telecommunications ministry and the japan welfare annuity of the ministry of health and welfare the sources said these ministries are trying to determine which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau s deposit rate the ministry sources said coupon rates on new year government bonds minus percentage points is the likeliest choice they added italian treasury cuts interest on certificates the italian treasury said annual coupon rates payable march on two issues of long term treasury certificates ccts would be cut by about four percentage points compared with rates this march coupon rates on year certificates maturing march will fall to pct from pct and rates on year issues maturing in march would fall to pct from pct the treasury also cut by point six monthly coupons payable this september on six issues maturing between september and september the issues carry terms of between five and seven years and will have coupon rates of between and pct in september compared with and pct this march japan to promote interest rate liberalisation the bank of japan decided at a policy board meeting to promote further interest rate liberalisation by lowering the minimum denomination of regulation free large deposits and by raising the interest rate ceiling on money market certificates mmcs a central bank official said the new guideline will go into effect on april the bank said under the guideline the minimum denomination of regulation free large deposits will be lowered to mln yen from mln the interest rate ceiling of mmcs with maturities of between one year and two years will be set at percentage point below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate the bank said but the ceiling on mmcs with maturities of one year or less will remain the same or percentage point below the cd rates the minimum denomination of mmcs will be lowered to mln yen from mln the bank also said time deposit rates will be lowered by point effective march in line with the half point cut in the official discount rate on february new interest rates on two year and one year deposits at banks for example will be pct and pct per annum respectively demand deposit rates however will remain the same major swiss banks raise customer time deposit rates point to three pct credit suisse corrected major swiss banks raise customer time deposit rates point to pct credit suisse fed expected to add temporary reserves the federal reserve is expected to enter the u s government securities market to add temporary reserves economists said they expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by arranging to two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements the fed may add the reserves directly instead via system repurchases federal funds which averaged pct yesterday opened at pct and stayed there in early trading analysts said the rate is under upward pressure partly from

spain deregulates bank deposit interest rates spain s finance ministry deregulated bank deposit rates in an effort to raise competition among banks and bring legislation into line with the european community ec a ministry spokesman said the measure was published today in the official state gazette it takes effect tomorrow and lifts restrictions on rates now limited to six pct on deposits of up to days the government also enacted a decree cutting to one pct from pct the proportion of total assets which banks must lend at favourable rates to industries classified of public interest some bankers expect the deregulation of rates to result in a pct drop in profits this year secretary of state for the economy guillermo de la dehesa told reuters in a recent interview the reduction in fixed asset investments would offset losses from the rate liberalisation bankers welcome spanish reserve requirement hike bankers welcomed the bank of spain s decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks saying it reflected the socialist government s determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity the central bank last night raised the requirement by one percentage point to pct from march saying that excess liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the bank which until now has relied on raising interest rates to choke off money supply growth i think it s a good measure a senior foreign banker said it s a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy it shows that the political will is very strong they know that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long run he added the head of another foreign bank said that only a month ago the bank of spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in reserve requirements preferring to pursue its strategy of raising interest rates but bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now around eight pct for overnight funds was attracting money from abroad strengthening the peseta and making spanish exports less competitive the government says industry s competitiveness is also being hit hard by inflation at pct last year the rate was way above that of spain s major trading partners in the european community which it joined a year ago to help meet this year s target of five pct it is insisting pay rises stay at that level setting the stage for clashes with trade unions who say they have made enough sacrifices demonstrations by workers students and farmers whose demands essentially involve more government spending have become an almost daily occurrence but prime minister felipe gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the money market too hard the bank of spain which only yesterday raised its key overnight call money rate to pct left it unchanged at today s auction the rate has been increased nine times since the start of the year when it was below pct bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months the measure will take effect tomorrow following the publication of the decree in today s official gazette bankers say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and inevitably push lending rates higher a companion measure reducing the proportion of funds which banks must invest in specific areas also takes effect tomorrow officials said when the cut was approved last month that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher interest rates fed not expected to take money market action the federal reserve is not expected to intervene in the u s government securities market to add or drain reserves economists said most economists said they did not expect the fed to add reserves with federal funds trading below six pct they said the funds rate s softer tone may indicate that the need to add reserves in the current bank reserve maintenance period is smaller than previously estimated fed funds opened at pct and remained at that level yesterday funds averaged pct bank of england resists pressure for rate cut the bank of england again fought against money and bond market pressure for a pre budget interest rate cut leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise in its trade weighted index to a six month high it closed at its best level since september at pct of its value on the index as foreign investors continued to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short term capital gains dealers said meanwhile opinion is divided over whether the bank can stop a cut before budget day march and why it should want to the bank s latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon when it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of pct to relieve a money market shortage they re really making the discount houses suffer said stephen lewis economist at brokerage house phillips and drew eleven and three quarters pct is way above money market rates this money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and tuesday so buyers came strongly into the pound the pound surged to a high of dlrs at the london close up from the previous finish at and marks up from if this pressure keeps up there is a possibility that rates could drop before the budget said jeremy hale economist at finance house goldman sachs international corp some gilt traders are forecasting a half point cut in the base rate from the current pct as early as tomorrow however analysts said the bank of england will need to be convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re rating rather than a result of short term speculative gains there are valid reasons for the bank to be cautious said peter fellner u k economist at brokers james capel and co markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a conservative party victory in any early general election and disappointment if prime minister margaret thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds fellner said an election could be delayed until mid but most forecasts say it will be this year others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar however analysts agree the bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether the authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move one way or the other to half points here and there some add the bank will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long term capital coming into the london market notably from japan they argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in washington the bank may want to see another few points on the trade weighted index before the budget argued lewis but by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the bank of england he added the bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders meanwhile analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the trade front today s figures showing that the current account deficit in was billion stg this was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a surplus of billion stg in fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals the guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets privately some bank officials forecast the bank will hold out at least for this week but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow if a move comes before march forecasts are for a half point cut with another half or full point about budget day fed s johnson says he does not see increasing pressure on interest rates bank of england pressure holds base rates this week s bank of england resistance to strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in holding bank base rates at pct but at a cost of threatening the chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson s policy stated at the end of the paris group of six meeting last month that he wanted to see sterling broadly stable about then prevailing levels market sources said since then the pound has risen to pct on its closing trade weighted index up from pct imediately after the paris meeting and up on the day today s peak at pct was its highest since august a treasury spokesman said lawson had said he neither wanted a substantial rise or fall in sterling the question is therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting paul temperton chief economist at merrill lynch europe ltd estimated that the government wanted to see the trade weighted index about pct even after this action over the last few weeks sterling s only just within striking distance of that range he said other analysts agree that the government probably has some broad target range around this area however they said lawson would be prepared to see the pound go higher at least in the short term despite the risk of a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports if the bank of england keeps the interest rates as they are what s to stop it going higher said john cox executive director of ebc amro bank ltd a major operator on the london foreign exchange market cox estimates that the bank of england has been active selling sterling over the past few days despite the lack of general market talk of such intervention and this has helped keep it below dlrs the pound rose to dlrs from yesterday and february the day after the paris meeting but cox says the government must be worried with sterling heading toward marks and would be very concerned if it holds around these levels he warned the bank may run the risk of missing the interest rate boat if rates don t come down the market will say they ought to have come down and will sell sterling he said most dealers agree there is a good deal of hot money being invested in sterling money simply attracted by high overnight or one week rates which could flow out at equally short notice however the authorities will hope that at least a proportion of the buying reflects long term investment the last thing they want to do is reduce them rates and have to jack them back up again said richard jeffrey economist at brokerage house hoare govett ltd he said a half point cut would ensure continued support for sterling at least in the near term however most analysts are still looking for a full point about march budget day the bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the budget said temperton the budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the run up to a general election the major factor behind current bullishness in the government bond and currency markets lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget he wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate cut said ian harwood economist at warburg securities the equities arm of mercury international group speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the way lower were confounded today there was excitement a fall in the weekly treasury bill rate to pct from pct last friday might mean the bank had changed its mind this followed the imposition of penal lending rates of pct on the discount houses yesterday and was the lowest since base rates were at pct early last october however with this bill rate pertaining to three months money banking sources said the market could not take the cut as a guide to the bank s intentions on short term rates hong kong banks leave interest rates unchanged the hong kong association of banks said it decided to leave interest rates unchanged at today s regular weekly meeting current rates are pct for savings accounts hours seven day call one week and two weeks one month is pct two months pct three and six months are both three pct nine months pct and months pct prime rate is six pct german government needs seen raising bond yields increased federal government borrowing needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push yields in german public authority bonds higher this year bond market sources say at the moment we have a sideways movement in the short term rates but how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on foreigners one portfolio manager for a large securities investment house in frankfurt said the sources also said the government had already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs friday s loan stock was the third this year already the sources noted it carried a year maturity a coupon of six pct and price of to yield pct at issue this compared with the last issue which had a pct coupon priced at pct for a yield of pct but dealers said the terms were not enough to attract foreign investors and the federal government would have to push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size with the introduction of a four billion mark volume only starting last may one finance ministry economist said it isn t more it s just the size of each bond which has increased he added conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new debt until recently federal issues sold very strongly abroad with up to pct of some being placed with foreign investors with the recent stabilisation of the u s dollar however foreign investors have begun to back away from the market as hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish sources said the government has may have already stepped up its borrowing having raised more than billion marks the government made net borrowings of billion marks in but bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was billion the sources said this indicated a move by the government out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the more acceptable loan stock form although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large amount of issues maturing recently other factors including the government s tax reduction program would also reduce income next year the problem here will be the tax reform the portfolio manager said he added that the government s cut in its top income tax rate to pct from pct in would make it difficult for the government to reduce borrowings the sources said the government would fall far short of covering all of its billion marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the other the portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal government loan stocks so far this year it has also fallen back twice to raise a total billion marks through the issue of fixed rate medium term kassenobligation notes a finance ministry economist said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a net billion marks this year though many sources agreed they added that the trend would probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come into effect i would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would mean government borrowing will increase the manager said bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance with the bundesbank s public authority bond yield calculation falling to pct on friday from a week earlier but sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan stock was slack as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise against the mark the demand wasn t so good a dealer for a german bank in london said the dollar s recent slight appreciation against the mark even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds

market sources said until the end of last week the central was holding out staunchly against market pressures for lower rates in an apparent effort to preserve the expected rate cuts for around the

treasury loan b a further mln stg was reserved for the national debt commissioners the market dropped by up to point following the bank s announcement with the treasury pct stock due quoted one full point lower at stg pct around minutes after the news dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the backdrop of intense pressure for lower u k interest rates which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of sterling s strength the bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to see lower rates and u k clearing banks this afternoon announced cuts in their base lending rates to pct from pct the bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate cut because dealers said the authorities had wished to delay a reduction until around the time of the u k budget on march thereby preserving the full impact of chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson s package of measures however in the face of sterling s apparently inexorable climb the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and allow a half point cut today s one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market as a move by the bank to eradicate hopes for a further early rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling most market participants believe that lawson will now foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time of the budget although one or two said they would not be surprised to see a full point decline at this stage dealers noted that as part of the authorities attempts last week to ease pressure for lower rates the bank had issued a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the government bond market to the surprise of most participants the issue was sold out within hours of becoming available for trading and the market pushed on to register further sharp gains dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as rapidly as last week s however they noted that although

rotberg said he told a news conference that rates in the u s japan west germany and switzerland were near their lows the weight of opinion is that in a year from now there is a higher probability there will be one pct higher than one pct lower interest rates he said the world bank had not issued floating rate notes so far this year because of the expectation of higher interest rates the policy of the world bank was to maintain liquidity at a level that gave the bank flexibility to decide when where and how much to borrow rotberg said cash in hand was now about pct of the next three years anticipated net requirement and comprised pct of outstanding debt and pct of its debt maturing within five years although the world bank had pioneered the swap market it did not intend to launch new financial instruments just for the sake of innovation rotberg said of a total of billion dlrs debt outstanding only some eight billion had been swapped into another currency many recent innovations were either unfair to investors or unfair to borrowers until the world bank was confident that this was not the case it would not adopt new instruments the world bank would raise pct of the funds needed over the next year with methods used before rotberg said however for some pct of new requirements the bank would try out new instruments such as bonds with warrants the world bank had publicly

sumita says little room for bank of japan to further ease credit policy sumita says little room for bank to ease policy bank of japan governor satoshi sumita said there is little room left for the central bank to further ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now approaching their lower limit the government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy he told a press conference his remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days at the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in paris japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable he said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets conflicting economic indicators from the u s have also been dampening market activity he added belgium cuts discount rate to pct

markets conflicting economic indicators from the u s have also been dampening market activity he added u s urges banks to weigh philippine debt plan the u s is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its third world debt strategy a reagan administration official said the official s comments also suggest that debtors pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms in addition he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a megabank where third world debt would be pooled and suggested the administration would support such a plan even though it was not formally proposing it at the same time however the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground the philippine proposal together with argentine suggestions that exit bonds be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan the official said in an interview with reuters all of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered said the official who asked not to be named in october washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund imf were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations in return america called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation free economic growth the multilaterals have been performing well the debtors have been performing well said the official but he admitted that the largest third world debtor brazil was clearly an exception the official who played a key role in developing the u s debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the third world debt crisis we called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively the official said among those ideas the official said were suggestions that commercial banks create a megabank which could swap third world debt paper for so called exit bonds for banks like regional american or european institutions such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled and has been suggested by argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of billion dlrs he emphasised that the megabank was not an administration plan but something some people have suggested other u s officials said japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume third world debt this plan actively under consideration would differ slightly from the one the official described but the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the united states if the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go fine i don t think they ever will he pointed out that banks would swap their third world loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution meanwhile the official praised the philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than pct above libor the philippine proposal is very interesting it s quite unique and i don t think it s something that should be categorically rejected out of hand the official said banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of philippine investment notes these tradeable dollar denominated notes would have a six year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity the country would guarantee a payment of point over libor until now bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low the talks now in their second week are aimed at stretching out repayments of billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on billion of already rescheduled debt the country which has enjoyed strong political support in washington since corazon aquino came to power early last year owes an overall billion dlrs of debt but the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation a development until now unacceptable to the banks it s no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over libor from what existed before the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek some people argue that cutting the spread is debt forgiveness what it really is is narrowing the spread on new money he added he said the u s debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the philippines jamaica agrees draft bank debt rescheduling jamaica agreed in principle with its bank advisory committee on a rescheduling of mln dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt falling due between and the jamaican information service said repayments on the debt will be stretched out over years with years grace at percentage points over the london interbank offered rate libor the margin on previously restructured debt also will be cut to point from the package should save jamaica about mln dlrs a year prime minister edward seaga who led the jamaican delegation called the terms very favourable to his country the agreement in principle with the bank advisory committee led by the bank of nova scotia bno to comes five days after jamaica successfully concluded a mln dlr rescheduling accord with the paris club of creditor nations that pact in turn followed the international monetary fund imf s approval on march of a mln special drawing rights standby arrangement and a mln sdr drawing under

reuter m brazil s gros to meet banks on trade line issue brazil s central bank governor francisco gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today in a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country s unilateral suspension of interest payments on billion dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt bankers said gros will meet representatives of citibank the head of brazil s bank advisory committee and of co heads morgan guaranty trust co and lloyds bank plc high on the agenda will be banks complaints about brazil s accompanying freeze on some billion dlrs of short term trade and interbank lines the bankers said brazil s several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed last march to extend the credit lines until march as part of a billion dlr financing package bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment coupled with brazil s freeze raised a spate of technical and legal questions that the banks want to discuss with gros they said they face problems because of the freeze requirement that any payment due to be made by a brazilian bank under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the central bank this means foreign bankers cannot easily switch their credit lines from one borrower to another the requirement to deposit with the central bank has also meant brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower interest rate spreads because foreign banks would rather accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the central bank it s caused a lot of ill will with the banking community one banker said gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of a day tour of europe and japan that he and finance minister dilson funaro have just completed to seek official support for brazil s debt stance bankers trust co raises broker

savings move points to lower u k rates u k interest rates look set to move lower even after monday s half point cut in bank base rates to pct analysts said citing as evidence the suspension of a british national savings issue yesterday the department of national savings effectively a treasury department unit yesterday suspended its nd issue launched in october and paying a high tax free pct on five year private investments between and stg a spokesman said the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the market the move was followed by a surprise sell out within minutes today of a bank of england one billion stg tap issue the second such issue in as many weeks analysts noted they said the near instant sale of the entire new gilts issue for which the bank of england had required a high pct downpayment was clear evidence that the market thought rates had to drop sooner rather than later the sale of the tranche of pct treasury bonds due occurred in an active bullish gilts market as downward pressure on money market rates remained intact with the bellwether three month interbank rate down point at pct it coincided with another strong sterling rally which pushed the pound to four year highs against the dollar that government stock disappeared very quickly indeed said stephen lewis head of economic research at stockbrokers phillips and drew it is an indication that the market believes rates are going to fall further at least by a half point immediately after the budget on march and some people hope for more stockbrokers james capel said in a comment the move by the national savings department was of considerable significance it said the real message is that the decks are being quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut in bank base rates to pct materialises building societies have said a drop in bank base rates would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a reduction in mortgage lending rates lewis of phillips and drew said he too believed the national savings issue suspension may reflect new u k treasury policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut national savings has been competing too effectively with the building societies of late building society income has been depressed in recent months he said he and other analysts said chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid on u k inflation underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in britain than in most other western economies with inflation seen rising well above four pct this year and above five pct in after last year s pct emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer prices lewis said a one point cut in building society rates would reduce inflation in britain by about pct but lewis and others noted that building societies had been complaining to the government about intense competition from national savings which they argued reduced the scope for early mortgage rate cuts the chancellor need not be worried about losing some psbr funding from national savings but he must be taking the building societies criticism to heart it looks like the national savings move reflects this one senior dealer said a savings department spokesman refused to comment on this interpretation saying the suspension of the issue was merely a reaction to the recent fall in u k interest rates which had pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with the rest of the market we are not politically motivated funding was just becoming too expensive and we don t need all that money he told reuters adding the department had suspended issues at least twice in the past when offered interest rates were above or below market rates he said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as u k money market rates continued their steady decline and income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion stg target set for fiscal ending march in the first months of fiscal national saving s contribution to government funding totalled billion stg compared with billion stg in the same period of the previous year official figures show figures for february out on monday are expected to show a further

percentage point reduction in leading banks base lending rates from pct building society and other bank mortgage rates are largely still well above the new base rate level although last year lloyds offered a fixed rate of pct on certain home loans a midland spokesman said his bank calculated that at the current level of billion stg its existing mortgage book accounts for about pct of the total british home loan market lloyds said it has billion stg in outstanding mortgage loans but had not estimated its total market share among other major clearing banks barclays plc bcs l and national westminister bank plc nwbl l said they had no immediate plans to announce similar fixed rate schemes philippine debt talks delayed for consultations today s debt rescheduling talks between the philippines government and its bank advisory committee were postponed until thursday to give the banks more time to consider manila s novel proposal for paying part of its interest bill in notes instead of cash bankers said the committee banks met briefly earlier today and decided that they needed more time in particular to consider a news report which quoted a reagan administration official as urging that the proposal be given serious consideration the banks felt that this was new information and that further consultation was called for one banker said in a despatch yesterday from washington reuters quoted the official as saying manila s plan to pay some interest with notes that could be converted into equity investments in the philippines was fully consistent with the reagan administration strategy for handling developing country debt the philippine proposal is very interesting it s quite unique and i don t think it s something that should be categorically rejected out of

doing anything said drexel burnham lambert analyst norman mains the narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading volume he noted we ve had a decline in activity as recent economic statistics have not greatly changed people s viewpoints on interest rates mains said the data which has provided not clear cut view of the economy coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange markets after the paris initiative has made for less than ebullient market action mains said he added however that treasury bond futures could be in for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the top of the trading range my view is that the economy remains relatively strong and market participants will see that current prices are unjustified mains said refco inc senior vice president michael connery also noted that the market is showing very little momentum and lacks retail interest all of the movement occurs at the opening afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades connery said although data during the week was mildly positive for bond prices the small rise in february producer prices and downward revisions in january retail sales and industrial production were not real exciting said prudential bache analyst fred leiner there is no one factor that will push us through the highs at this moment leiner said next week s revision to fourth quarter u s gross national product is also likely to be of little interest to the market said kleinwort benson chief financial economist sam kahan still forecasts for first quarter gnp could play a role in the direction of bond prices over the next month kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is around three pct due largely to a buildup in inventories reflected in the january inventory data friday which showed the largest increase since the key question will be not whether there is a large increase in first quarter gnp but whether any increase is sustainable or a one shot deal kahan said he said that a sizable increase in first quarter gnp stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on second quarter growth if that is the case gnp in the second quarter could ease back to a one to two pct growth rate kahan said philippines sees government revenue up pct philippine government revenue is expected to rise pct to billion pesos this year from billion in finance secretary jaime ongpin said in a report to president corazon aquino on his department s performance during the year ended february ongpin said at least billion pesos were expected to accrue from new tax reform

rate levels and the volume of government securities sold to the private sector have improved significantly in particular short term prime interest rates which had gone over pct in are now down to less

approvals of only mln dlrs at end february he said his department aims to accelerate its privatisation program and the sale of non performing assets owned by associates of former president ferdinand marcos to achieve a sales target of four billion pesos which would help finance land reform aquino said earlier this month that all the billion pesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the

one point cut in u k base rate british bank base lending rates are likely to fall by as much as one full point to pct this week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the u k central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in today s budget bank analysts said the analysts described chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson s budget as cautious a quality which currency and money markets had already started to reward sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget measures came through the analysts said lloyds merchant bank chief economist roger bootle said he expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow this is very much a safety first budget in order to get interest rates down he said bootle said the money markets had almost entirely discounted such a one point cut with the key three month interbank rate down to pct from last night and it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a half point cut now midland bank treasury economist david simmonds said he too expected base rates would be a full point lower by friday but this would likely happen via two half point cuts this budget is designed to please both the markets and the electorate the implications for interest rates are very favourable we could have a half point cut tomrorow and another such cut before the end of the week simmonds said pointing to buoyant u k retail data released yesterday he said lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target there is no real need to boost private consumption he said national westminster bank chief economist david kern said the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the likelihood of an early one point base rate cut kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully in particular to see how exactly lawson planned to achieve the sharper than expected borrowing target cut before a one point base rate cut could be implemented but providing the budget small print was convincing and i suspect it will be it is entirely possible that we see one point off base rates by the end of this week kern said bootle of lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave the way for an early one point cut in mortgage lending rates this would help achieve lawson s lower

some four billion stg british banks base lending rates fell a half percentage point on march to the current pct thai banks weigh new interest rate cut officials of five thai commercial banks are expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cutting interest rates banking sources said they said they expect thai banks to opt for a cut to spur domestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity on the money market many bankers have been urging an average half percentage point cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending rates they said six major thai major banks reduced minimum loan and overdraft rates by to percentage point on february but the move has not substantially increased loan demand the sources said excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since early last year despite five interest rate cuts in the current gross pct interest rate for one year fixed bank deposit and the pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade bankers said the thai banking system is saddled with about to billion baht of surplus funds which have created problems for many banks in managing their money effectively profits of many thai banks fell sharply last year partly because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth the bank of thailand estimated overall lending by the thai banking system grew pct in against a pct expansion in bank deposits reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have further buoyed the thai stock market this week the securities exchange of thailand set index on monday recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years shooting up points to a new seven year high of brokers and market analysts said thai stocks will register more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will grow if the bank of thailand does not extend permission for local banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to pct of bank capital if the regulation is not extended beyond its april expiry date many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign exchange holdings to a maximum pct bankers said such that could add another five billion baht of surplus funds to the local money

point cut in base rates today but some were not surprised by the authorities caution dealers added lawson says he favours gradual approach to cuts in u k interest rates west german banks slowly cutting key savings rates west german commercial banks are cautiously cutting key savings and lending rates banking sources said the cuts follow nearly two months after the bundesbank reduced leading interest rates far longer than the usual interim period a deutsche bank ag dbkg f spokesman said it is cutting leading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis by percentage points to two pct dresdner bank ag drsd f and commerzbank ag cbkg f have initiated similar moves bank fuer gemeinwirtschaft ag bkfg f cut rates pct generally the delay was partly due to commercial banks desire to gauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings banks a fall in customer savings because of lower rates could reduce cheap refinancing available to banks forcing them to draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources one economist at the german banking association said but the volume of savings funds may not be substantially undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest them at higher yields in the future he said he said this may conflict with bundesbank aims to move more funds from relatively short term deposits to longer dated securities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money supply aggregate the aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional pct in february against the fourth quarter of last year unchanged from january the growth rate was outside the expanded target range of three to six pct few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private customers though lending rates for corporate customers are beginning to decline bank of england lends one billion stg at pct the bank of england said it had lent one billion stg to the discount market

futures will break out of their narrow ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week we got a little volatility wednesday said staley commodities international analyst jerome lacey but for the moment we re still in a trading range even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the u s economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its sluggish state the analysts said it the bond market has not yet demonstrated that it can break out of its very low volatility said carroll mcentee and mcginley analyst denis karnosky it needs something but it s not going to be news about the economy he said karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has stabilized and the federal reserve has more room to conduct monetary policy but even wednesday when fed funds were below six pct the dollar strong and oil on the soft side bond futures attracted eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs he said in addition to a changing perception about the dollar and monetary policy golden gate futures president norman quinn said the beginning of april could bring foreign investors back into the marketplace the market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the beginning of the fiscal year in japan on april quinn said quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are large amounts of cash waiting to be invested if japanese investment in u s securities does materialize at the start of japan s fiscal year domestic funds may also flow into the bond market he said we could get a stiff rally possibly enough to bring yields on long bonds down to seven to pct compared to the current yield of about pct quinn said in the meantime even the prospect of new supply is not likely to move futures the treasury s announcement of a billion dlr refunding operation did little to move cash government securities prices late wednesday after the close of futures i d be surprised if supply pushed us out of it the trading range lacey said bundesbank leaves credit policies unchanged the bundesbank left credit policies unchanged after today s regular meeting of its council a spokesman said in answer to enquiries the west german discount rate remains at pct and the lombard emergency financing rate at pct german banks see low interest rates continuing the association of german cooperative banks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rates would continue to remain low for the time being it said the bundesbank could hold them down despite strong foreign influence and it saw no interest straining factors in the economy that could affect the long term capital market the inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for higher nominal interest rates but a probable rise in inflation late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in nominal rates at year s end and next year it said the association said generally low interest rates prospects of lower taxes a stable dollar rate and expected strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue its slow but very sure growth the bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest rates down on the short term money market although its policies had exerted little effect on the long term capital market which was so important for investment financing and thus for the course of the economy it said in view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy had in influencing the longer term capital market the association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy through a short term and expansionist monetary policy on the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of the association said time would show to what extent speculative foreign money and short term invested domestic money would distort money supply developments the bundesbank

recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates as seen in last month s paris pact extend to keeping down european interest rates banking economists said but in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate west germany s economy they said the paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention economists said economists speculated that g countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling u s and west german interest rates further when they meet for the imf interim committee in april the recent round of monetary accommodation by the bundesbank and the bank of japan and the firming of the federal funds rate are significant they mark an uncoupling of movements in u s and foreign interest rates salomon bros inc said in a recent study it said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar s fall these spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized west german bundesbank president karl otto poehl encouraged the u s not to cut interest rates in january when the bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point to avoid weakening the dollar west german economists see room for further cuts in leading west german rates if the dollar resumes its decline it s not a taboo peter pietsch spokesman for commerzbank ag said but most economists see room for a cut in west german rates only in the first half of the year as re emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year the bundesbank s average yield of public paper is already nearing last year s low last week yields fell to around pct not far from the low of pct posted in mid april economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer term paper such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long term rates which has become more pronounced since the bundesbank lowered its discount rate it might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the bundesbank s central bank money stock aggregate but conflicting with this trend are plans to increase west german tax cuts part of the paris currency pact designed to meet u s demands for faster west german growth this move may force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing this may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak but demand could emerge if rates begin rising economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth and higher than expected spending josef koerner chief economist of the west german ifo institut said in a newspaper interview he expected tax revenue to be some billion marks below estimates by the west german government in november any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up but coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar s decline long term yields may to have to rise economists said public authority borrowing in may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of bonn s tax reform package the west german government is raising its total tax cuts in by billion marks to billion west german chancellor helmut kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said last thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform such as raising indirect taxes but few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing the bundesbank said in its february report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in could be managed without increasing deficits the bundesbank said west german public authorities borrowed a large billion marks in credit markets in the final quarter compared with billion in fourth quarter the federal government took up nearly billion marks of the fourth quarter

creditors had filed court actions against brazil to seek payment of its billion dlr debt there is no court action against brazil gros said in a television interview brazil last month suspended

longer term forecast envisioned that we will maintain and improve upon our progress in bringing down the rate of inflation fed sets billion dlr customer repurchase fed says fed adds reserves via customer repurchases the federal reserve entered the u s government securities market to arrange billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements a fed spokesman said dealers said federal funds were trading at pct when the fed began its temporary and indirect supply of reserves to the banking system citibank says it raises base rate to pct from pct chase manhattan raises prime rate to pct from effective today analysts see slow move to higher u s prime rate quarter point prime rate increases to pct by citibank and chase manhattan bank today will be followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of the federal reserve s policy intentions economists said based on the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate it probably makes sense for others to follow but no rush is likely said paul mcculley of e f hutton and co citibank s surprise base rate increase quickly followed by chase sent u s bond prices lower and the dollar higher mcculley said that once the spread between three month certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than percentage points there is a strong chance of a prime rate increase it has been under points recently however banks are likely to hold rate increases until they see what the fed intends to do about interest rates in the near term analysts said they noted that banks historically like to follow fed rate movements rather than lead them for example the last prime rate increase occurred in june when banks lifted the rate to pct from pct after a fed discount rate increase in april of that year major banks had been posting a pct prime rate since last august when they lowered the rate from eight pct shortly after the fed s half point discount rate cut to the current pct level on august the banks will not rush to raise their prime rates there should be a split prime for a while with some posting a pct rate and others pct said david jones of aubrey g lanston and co jones said the federal open market committee at today s meeting voted no change in fed policy but he said the fed may well foster higher interest rates soon jones said that while the fomc probably voted no policy change today it may have decided to apply slight upward rate pressure later if the dollar weakens inflation pressures heat up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery the fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to tighten policy when they did today s coupon pass said joseph liro of s g warburg and co in a move that came a day earlier than most expected the fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by offering to buy all maturities of treasury notes and bonds for its own account this seasonal reserve add is called a pass the fed demonstrated that there has been no policy change said elizabeth reiners economist at dean witter reynolds inc she said the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate is now around basis points compared with a basis point average in reiners said the spread is not really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate increase the dean witter economist said that today s prime rate rise may have been less a response to interest rates than an attempt to enhance the balance sheet bottom line reiners said that given recent problems with loans to developing countries large money center banks with heavy exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans the federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money to one another could help determine how many banks match the higher prime rate and also how quickly they move in raising their prime rates banks cited a higher cost of funds in the three business days through monday the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly pct but quarter end pressures helped push up funds the fed funds rate was extremely volatile today reflecting demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the close of the japanese fiscal year funds traded between five and pct once the special distortions end analysts said the funds rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the pct area they said that if it stabilizes near there banks may not quickly boost their prime rates but a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many that the fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to help the dollar then banks would lift prime rates quickly h k banks to raise prime rates soon dealers say banks in hong kong are likely to raise prime rates by half a percentage point to pct

included reducing commercial bank lending rates that have ranged between pct and pct by one percentage point new rates which affect both indian and foreign banks also include a one percentage point gain to an annual pct on deposits of two years or more but less than five bank deposits of five years or more carrying pct interest have been abolished bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the government s concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help improve world competitiveness of indian goods there is likely to be a shift to short term bank deposits by long term depositors bankers predicted this will create the flexibility to draw and re invest funds in either equity shares or short term bank deposits they said a merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs due to lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market tata steel a trend setter on the bombay stock exchange opened today higher at rupees against yesterday s closing of

months u s credit market outlook prime rate the prospect that other banks will follow industry leaders citibank and chase manhattan in raising their prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit markets today economists said bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days of heavy selling when citibank surprised the market by announcing a quarter point increase in its prime rate to pct chase manhattan quickly followed prices quickly fell by a full point even though the dollar the market s overriding concern of late rose sharply on the news citibank cited the higher cost of money especially in the euromarket as the reason for raising its prime rate part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears of a tighter federal reserve policy to defend the dollar but economists said it is too early to tell whether the fed whose policy making federal open market committee fomc meets this week is already tightening its grip on credit the fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the banking system s reserve needs this statement period but i wouldn t conclude anything until i ve seen the fed data said jeffrey leeds of chemical bank reuter m bundesbank will not hold
