american express axp seen in possible spinnoff american express co remained silent on market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its shearson lehman brothers inc but some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock american express stock got a lift from the rumor as the market calculated a partially public shearson may command a good market value thereby boosting the total value of american express the rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend american express closed on the new york stock exchange at up on heavy volume american express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity analysts said comments by the company at an analysts meeting tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement yesterday of management changes at the meeting company officials said american express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of shearson according to analysts yesterday shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer jeffery lane to the added position of president which had been vacant it also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff some analysts however disagreed that any spinoff of shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for american express contributing about pct of earnings last year i think it is highly unlikely that american express is going to sell shearson said perrin long of lipper analytical he questioned what would be a better investment than a very profitable securities firm several analysts said american express is not in need of cash which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset but others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of shearson and one rumor suggests selling about pct of it in the market larry eckenfelder of prudential bache securities said he believes american express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place shearson s book value is in the mln dlr range shearson in the market place would probably be worth three to bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization said eckenfelder some analysts said american express could use capital since it plans to expand globally they have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital you want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road said e f hutton group analyst michael lewis they ve outlined the fact that they re investing heavily in the future which goes heavily into the international arena said lewis that does not preclude acquisitions and divestitures along the way he said lewis said if american express reduced its exposure to the brokerage business by selling part of shearson its stock might better reflect other assets such as the travel related services business it could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage the value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the company he said lewis said shearson contributed mln in after tax operating earnings up from about mln dlrs in hong kong firm ups wrather wco stake to pct industrial equity pacific ltd a hong kong
