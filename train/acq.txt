american express axp seen in possible spinnoff american express co remained silent on market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its shearson lehman brothers inc but some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock american express stock got a lift from the rumor as the market calculated a partially public shearson may command a good market value thereby boosting the total value of american express the rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend american express closed on the new york stock exchange at up on heavy volume american express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity analysts said comments by the company at an analysts meeting tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement yesterday of management changes at the meeting company officials said american express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of shearson according to analysts yesterday shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer jeffery lane to the added position of president which had been vacant it also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff some analysts however disagreed that any spinoff of shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for american express contributing about pct of earnings last year i think it is highly unlikely that american express is going to sell shearson said perrin long of lipper analytical he questioned what would be a better investment than a very profitable securities firm several analysts said american express is not in need of cash which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset but others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of shearson and one rumor suggests selling about pct of it in the market larry eckenfelder of prudential bache securities said he believes american express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place shearson s book value is in the mln dlr range shearson in the market place would probably be worth three to bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization said eckenfelder some analysts said american express could use capital since it plans to expand globally they have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital you want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road said e f hutton group analyst michael lewis they ve outlined the fact that they re investing heavily in the future which goes heavily into the international arena said lewis that does not preclude acquisitions and divestitures along the way he said lewis said if american express reduced its exposure to the brokerage business by selling part of shearson its stock might better reflect other assets such as the travel related services business it could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage the value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the

because a similar statement was being circulated to employees analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for american express to give up a stake in the wholly owned brokerage which improved

the value of the brokerage firm shearson contributed mln dlrs of american express billion dlr net in american express ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash

suitor usair group or alternatively to merge with piedmont and usair piedmont s board was meeting today and wall street speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from norfolk southern corp and usair the twa offer was announced shortly after the piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin twa offered to buy usair for dlrs cash per share it also said it was the largest shareholder of usair and threatened to go directly to usair shareholders with an offer for pct of the stock at a lower price twa also said it believed its offer was a better deal for usair shareholders than an acquisition of piedmont but it said it alternatively would discuss a three way combination of the airlines market sources and analysts speculated that twa chairman carl icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into the takeover arena we re just wondering if he s not just trying to get twa into play there s speculation on the street he just wants to move onto somthing else said one arbitrager we think twa might just be putting up a trial balloon analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by usair but that the airline will probably reject it because the price is relatively low compared to other airline deals they also said icahn must prove his offer credible by revealing financing arrangements they need to show their commitment and their ability to finance i think it s a credible offer said timothy pettee a bear stearns analyst i think it s certainly on the low end of relative values of airline deals said pettee pettee estimated dlrs would be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers usair stock soared after twa made public its offer a spokesman for usair declined comment and said usair had not changed its offer for piedmont usair offered of buy pct of that airline s stock for dlrs cash per share and the balance for dlrs per share in usair stock usair closed up at on volume of mln shares piedmont which slipped to close at also remained silent on the twa action piedmont has an outstanding dlr cash per share offer from norfolk southern corp norfolk southern declined comment but said it stuck with its offer for piedmont norfolk owns about pct of piedmont and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover of piedmont some analysts said icahn may be trying to acquire usair to make his own airline a more attractive takeover target icahn i think had wanted to sell his airline and there were no takers i think the strategy might have called for making his investment more attractive one way to accomplish that specific objective is to go out and acquire other airlines said andrew kim of eberstadt fleming i don t know whose going to buy them but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package said kim but icahn s financing ability for such a transaction remains in doubt in part because of twa s heavy debt load wall street sources said twa has some cash with which to do the offer the sources said icahn has not lined up outside financial advisers and plans to make his own arrangements icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy usx corp x and still retains pct of that company s stock some wall street sources said the financier s usx plan was impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser drexel burnham lambert inc because of wall street s insider trading scandal industry sources also predicted usair might reject the twa offer on price and financing concerns it s littered with contingencies and it doesn t even have a financing arrangement said one executive at another major airline but the executive conceded a merged twa usair would be a strong contender with usair s east coast route system and planned west coast presence from psa usair could feed the intenrational flights of twa which has a midwest presence in its st louis hub adding piedmont dominant in the southeast to the mix would develop an even stronger force the combined entity would also have twa s pars reservation system

to a u s department of justice requirement that baker sell off several specialised subsidiaries in businesses related to oil drilling the hughes board last week indicated that it might cancel the

group rejects trans world airlines takeover bid baker bko sues to force hughes ht merger baker international corp said it has filed suit in state court in houston to compel hughes tool co to complete its proposed merger with baker late yesterday hughes said it had terminated the merger agreement because baker would not agree to an alternative divestiture plan devised by hughes hughes board had previously found unacceptable a u s justice department consent decree that would have required broader divestitures baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation from hughes of its objections to the provisions of the justice department consent decree hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the counting of votes on the deal baker said it believes the vote was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger baker said the new terms that hughes proposed for the merger as an alternative to the consent decree were more burdensome than those of the consent decree themselves baker said divestitures under the consent decree would reduce revenues for the combined company by about mln dlrs or three pct baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of the units named in the consent decree it said its suit names as defendants hughes and certain of its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing hughes to live up to the merger agreement or substantial monetary damages it did not name baker said it believes the merger to be in the best interests of shareholders of both companies usair u rejects twa twa takeover bid usair group inc said its board has rejected trans world airlines inc s offer to acquire usair for dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in the best interests of usair shareholders employees or passengers the company said the unsolicited bid by the carl c icahn led twa was highly conditional usair said its board and that of piedmont aviation inc pie met separately yesterday to consider usair s offer to acquire pct of piedmont for dlrs per share and remaining shares for to common shares each valued at about dlrs per share based on the average closing price of usair common during a period just before the merger the company said it is continuing talks with piedmont on arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies hope to reach one very shortly usair said in light of the highly conditional nature and other terms of the twa offer the timing of the offer and the circumstances under which it was made usair group believes that the purpose of the twa offer is to interfere with usair group s proposed acquisition of piedmont twa s proposal is nothing more than an attempt by carl icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour usair group s acquisition of piedmont a transaction which the usair group board views as most beneficial to usair group shareholders employees and passengers and which mr icahn obviously regards as contrary to his own personal interests usair said its board has authorized counsel to explore all appropriate legal remedies against what it called twa s last minute attempt to interfere with usair group s acquisition of piedmont the company said conditions to the twa offer include twa obtaining financing the usair board redeeming defensive rights issued to shareholders last year and acting to render

created by merger mania is particularly distressing shad said the recent cases involving ivan boesky dennis levine and others was a warning that those who engage in insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment high fines and disbarment from the securities industry insider trading has not been eradicated but it has been inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that boesky and

would result in a billion dlr oil field service company we re working very hard on this merger hughes board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for march to give baker more time to consider the counter proposal the hughes board which had previously expressed concern about a u s department of justice consent decree that would require baker to sell its drilling bit operations and submersible pump business met yesterday and threatened to terminate the proposed merger the hughes board made a counter proposal that the two companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses before signing the decree the directors of baker immediately after receiving the counter proposal filed a law suit in texas in a texas state court to force to hughes to complete the merger the uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might be imposed by the department of justice makes us very nervous about what the outcome might be kistler said in explaining why hughes had made the counter proposal we need additional time to understand why baker did not accept our proposal kistler also said that the law suit filed by baker was not a factor in the board s decision to keep its merger proposal on the table he declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit kistler said hughes would be willing to consider a compromise counter proposal but declined to be more specific the justice department in january said it would block the hughes and baker merger on anti trust grounds unless both companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide for the sale of the assets after the merger took place the hughes board said it would not sign the decree because its was too unreasonable hughes said that baker should instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the merger is finalized and given government approval under the decree if baker is unable to find acceptable buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is approved a federal trustee would become responsible for finding a buyer kistler said that under those terms the trustee could take up to years to complete the sales he also expressed concern that the combined companies might be required by the government s conditions to license some of its technology to any purchaser of the assets baker said last night in a statement that the required assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about mln dlrs representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined companies france to sell stake in societe generale unit the french government is

aviation inc which was being courted by usair yesterday icahn s transworld airlines inc twa made a billion dlr offer for usair group the move complicated a usair takeover offer for piedmont which was believed to be close to accepting the bid today usair rejected icahn s dlr per share offer and said the bid was a last minute effort to interfere in its takeover of piedmont icahn was unavailable for comment piedmont fell one to on volume of twa was off to usair fell to as doubt spread it would be taken over analysts and market sources view the twa bid as an attempt to either trigger a counter offer from usair or to attract a suitor who might want both airlines once they merged the next move is either icahn starts a tender offer or piedmont and usair announce a deal speculated one arbitrager some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current price of piedmont since it is not clear that usair s bid will succeed piedmont s largest shareholder and other suitor norfolk southern corp nsc has offered dlrs per share for the company usair offered dlrs cash per share for half of piedmont stock and dlrs per share in stock for the balance some arbitragers however believe the depressed price of piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is destined to be acquired by someone usair they said is the least likely to be bought icahn who has long talked about further consolidation in the airline industry also offered usair the alternative of a three way airline combination including twa and piedmont but wall street has given little credibility to icahn s offer which lacked financing and was riddled with contingencies still he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two airlines both of which analysts said would fit well with twa you can t discount him said one arbitrager analysts however said icahn would have to prove he is serious by following through with his threats or making a new offer in making the offer for usair icahn threatened to go directly to shareholders for pct of the stock at a lower price if usair rejected his offer it s clear icahn wants to sell and he s bluffing said one arbitrager analysts said the dlr per share offer was underpriced by about six dlrs per share some analysts believe icahn s proposed three way airline combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles but others believe it could be cleared if the companies are acquired separately twa would have to be the surviving company for the deal to work said one analyst analysts said such a merger would be costly and complicated twa has the best cost structure since icahn succeeded in winning concessions from its unions in order for the other carriers to come down to twa s wage scale in a merger twa would have to be the surviving entity analysts said such a move does not necessarily free icahn of twa they said they said he showed skill in reducing ozark airlines costs when he merged it into twa last year and he might be a necessary ingredient for a merger to work however other analysts speculated the managements of piedmont and usair would not tolerate icahn as head of a new company they said a usair acquisition of twa might be a way for him to exit the company if usair s airline is then merged into twa baker int l bko hopes to complete merger baker international corp treasurer eric mattson said the company hoped to iron out snags in

decree until after baker s submersible pump and drilling bit operations were sold mattson told reuters that baker still believed a merger was possible between the two giant oilfield service companies the company s position is we would like to see the merger be completed which is in the best interests of our shareholders and their shareholders mattson said our goal is for a merger to occur because of the litigation i can t go any further than that he said baker filed a lawsuit in texas state court late yesterday to force hughes to abide by terms of the proposed consent decree mattson also

a proposed merger with baker international corp bko wall street analysts said last night hughes said the planned merger with baker was off baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from hughes for calling off the merger at midday today hughes said it was still interested in the merger the analysts also said hughes may be worried that its troubles could make it a takeover candidate there was speculation today that harold simmons the dallas investor might try to acquire hughes but simmons told reuters he is not interested simmons said he intends to file a d with the securities and exchange monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in some publicly traded company he declined to identify the target other than to rule out hughes one analyst said another factor in the latest hughes turnabout was borg warner corp bor which owns pct of hughes borg warner ex chairman j f bere who serves on the hughes board is believed to favor the merger with baker despite the hughes statement that it is interested in a merger and baker s response that a merger is still possibile analysts said no one could be certain where the situation was going i think the merger is not going through said phil pace analyst at kidder peabody and co he said the merger lost a lot of its appeal when the u s department of justice required that baker sell off its reed tool co operation although the reed operation is relatively small in view of the total size of a combined baker hughes pace said to pct of the cost savings are tied up in that they hughes are obviously concerned about the lawsuit said james crandell analyst at salomon brothers inc apparently they are willing to continue discussions but whether they will alter their position i don t know it s getting a little confusing said james carroll analyst at painewebber group inc he said the arguments cited by hughes yesterday for not doing the merger tend to be weak hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it wanted reed tool and other businesses sold prior to april the projected merger date a government decree allowed a longer period of time hughes contended it was better to formally combine the companies with the status of reed already settled baker apparently sees no reason to speed up the sale carroll said baker had previously estimated to mln dlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling reed but he said baker now thinks to mln dlrs will be saved while hughes sees a saving of only to mln dlrs carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first signed the outlook for the industry has improved materially hughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry is lifting armtek arm sells tire truck tire business armtek corp formerly known as armstrong rubber co said it

imperial bank of commerce to sell its pct stake in encor energy corp ltd energy industry analysts said dome has pledged its mln encor shares as security for part of its debt to commerce bank estimated last year at mln canadian dlrs and the bank wants dome to sell the stock to pay down debt analysts said the commerce has been slowly but surely moving encor in the direction that might make it a saleable asset said one analyst who asked not to be named dome earlier said it was not considering selling encor energy but reaffirmed the company s pct interest in canadian gold producer dome mines ltd dm is up for sale at the right price dome now negotiating a plan to restructure more than billion dlrs in debt sees encor as a strategic investment that it does not intend to sell spokesman david annesley said the encor shares do not pay dividends a commerce bank spokesman also declined comment when asked whether it is pressing dome to sell its encor stake at current market prices dome s stake in encor would be valued at about mln dlrs while its mln dome mines shares would be worth about mln dlrs recent strength in the price of encor shares may also prompt commerce bank to press dome to divest its holding in the canadian oil and gas producer analysts said encor s stock price has improved quite substantially in recent weeks with a runup in crude prices peters and co ltd oil analyst wilf gobert commented the possibility is that commerce bank would like to see it sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than they have been able to in recent years he added encor traded earlier on the toronto stock exchange at near its week high of and up from around six dlrs in early february the company also recently set up its own operating management which was previously carried out by dome petroleum maison placements canada inc analyst denis mote commented dome and encor are actually going to get farther apart so the sale does make a lot of sense mote said however analysts said dome will resist any moves to divest encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale proceeds would likely go directly to pay down dome s debt to commerce bank i think they ll probably try to hang onto encor as long as they can said bache securities inc analyst doug weber some of dome s group of major creditors might move to block such a sale arguing they have a claim on company assets other creditors generally all want to make sure that something they might be able to get a piece of is not being sold out from under them said analyst gobert another stumbling block would be encor s mln dlr joint liability in loans to dome petroleum advanced by arctic petroleum corp of japan for beaufort sea exploration analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the possible sale of dome petroleum s interest in dome mines dome mines has guaranteed mln dlrs of dome petroleum s debt and has a right of consent to the sale of dome petroleum s holding presumably a potential buyer of the dome mines shares would seek some type of relief on the company s debt obligations connected with dome petroleum gobert said dome spokesman annesley earlier declined to specify

american motor debt that chrysler will assume analysts said they said chrysler s cost of acquisition was valued at mln dlrs paid in cash notes and chrysler shares the analysts told reuters that at a new york briefing chrysler treasurer fred zuckerman outlined his company s agreement with renault to assume amc s debt as well as mln dlrs in unfunded pension liabilities though the latter is not included valuing the transaction analysts were generally positive on chrysler s proposed purchase of its much smaller rival but said they expected the transaction would carry with it a short term dilution in chrysler s earnings a chrysler financial source speaking anonymously told reuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than it would have been had a deal been struck last year because the impact of the new u s tax law removes chrysler s ability to assume amc s large reserve of tax loss carryforwards accumulated from its losses since there were very serious discussions last fall but we didn t pull it off the source said in a reference to the assassination in november of former renault chairman georges besse it s too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor and renault could have gotten a much better price if we d done it before the end of last year in addition to amc s debt and its pension liabilities the source said chrysler would also assume any liability from lawsuits over the safety of jeeps which he called an overhang to the company analysts quoted chrysler officials as having told them that the deal includes payment to renault of mln dlrs principal

may downgrade billion dlrs of chrysler corp and unit debt due to the deal but the chrysler source said that in assuming amc s liabilities his company will refinance at a lower rate any amc debt that is being carried at non market rates he said there were difficulties in negotiating with the previous renault management on the acquisition because they were committed to the group s business plan of

american motors corp amo should help bolster the small automaker s sales but it leaves the future of its employees in doubt industry analysts say it was business as usual yesterday at the american motors headquarters one day after the proposed merger was unveiled by chrysler and amc s french parent renault according to company spokesman edd snyder but amc s future to be discussed at a board meeting today would be radically different as a chrysler subsidiary than if it had continued with the state run french car group as its controlling shareholder industry analysts said the future of amc s car assembly plant in kenosha wis and its toledo ohio jeep plant would be in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the north american auto industry by the early s comes to pass both plants are far from state of the art for car manufacturing sites and amc has a history of poor labor relations at each chrysler doesn t need that many new plants said michael luckey automotive analyst for the wall street firm shearson lehman brothers they probably will close the toledo plant and move jeep production to canada ronald glantz of montgomery securities said that at the very least the new owner of the toledo plant would be able to wring concessions from the united automobile workers union local representing jeep workers the uaw won t be able to hold them up for ransom as they have amc because during a down year chrysler will have underutilized facilities to transfer production he said analysts said they foresaw no major complications that would abort a combination which historians said would be the auto industry s biggest merger since american motors was formed in amc was in need of a financial savior because of its losses of more than mln dlrs since and pressures in france for renault to cut its backing the company had said it could not forecast consistent profitability until at the earliest in announcing the takeover agreement chrysler chairman lee iacocca cited amc s jeep division as well as its new mln dlr assembly plant at bramalea ontario and its network of dealers as the major attractions analysts reasoned that chrysler might feel moved eventually to sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overhead costs in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incur in the amc buyout pacer systems to make acquisition pacer systems said it has agreed in

for comment traders noted that activity in the stock increased today after a published report linked pickens to tenneco tenneco rose two points to paul feretti an analyst with new orleans based howard weil labouisse friedrichs inc said he was not surprised at market rumors that tenneco might be the target of a takeover attempt it s pure market speculation that boone pickens and his group may be interested feretti said but tenneco would be a challenge to run because of its sheer size and diversity mr pickens is a man who likes a challenge pickens who made an unsuccessful attempt to take over dallas based diamond shamrock corp dia last winter has made no secret of his plans to acquire additional natural gas reserves in the belief that gas prices will stabilize sooner than oil prices

any hostile takeover drexel burnham lambert inc s houston based analyst john olson said putting little credence in the rumors tenneco is a gargantuan enterprise with seven billion dlrs in long term debt and preferred stock outstanding he said the buyer would also have to deal with the intractable problems tenneco faces with its farm equipment unit and energy businesses analysts suggested that tenneco could use a number of defensive strategies to fend off an unwanted buyer such as spin off some of its non energy businesses directly to shareholders buy back shares or create a limited

suitor for the company traders said purolator agreed in late february to a dlr a share mln dlr offer from e f hutton lbo inc and certain members of its purolator courier division s management the stock today hit up one today purolator revealed in a filing with the securities and exchange commission that director doresy gardner resigned from its board of directors in a letter dated march the letter from gardner said he resigned the board because the merger agreement with hutton barred directors from soliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a better deal gardner said he believes a better offer might be found if the company would agree to be sold to some other entity or if it could sell off all or part of its u s courier division basically the courier division is a company that has mln dlrs in revenues it s a very large company and it s being sold for or mln dlrs said gardner in a telephone interview with reuters gardner is an official of kelso management a firm associated with fidelity international ltd a group of fidelity companies owns eight pct of purolator and gardner said he personally owns shares a purolator official said the company has no comment on the letter from gardner arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service may emerge as a likely bidder for purolator before the transaction with hutton lbo was announced analysts had also speculated another courier company would be the most likely suitor while one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no new bidders he said the possibility one could appear pushed the stock into play again there s no shortage of possibilities it s just a question of management s willingness to let the process continue said one arbitrager arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they believe hutton lbo has taken on no risk in the transaction hutton has begun a tender for pct of purolator at dlrs cash per share the balance of purolator s stock will be bought for securities and warrants in a new company holding the u s courier operations the arbitragers said tender offer documents show that hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and will emerge with a giant majority equity interest in purolator as far as i can tell from the public documents from the deal that s on the table hutton is basically putting up zero one always likes a situation like that you always like to think if they can do this deal at no risk there should be someone else in the world that could do it higher said one arbitrager the firm however is supplying temporary financing and sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the firm will not end up paying for its equity position while one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document did note that the e f hutton group subsidiary may not have to keep cash in the transaction the sources said there is some risk to the firm there are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash and all sorts of things that make it very speculative said one of the sources adding there are also severance payments to employees the e f hutton group subsidiary is supplying mln dlrs in so called bridge financing for the transaction the bridge financing is a temporary loan from hutton the financing is to be replaced with permanent financing expected to come from banks however it may take some time to replace the financing the source said resulting in what could be a substantial expense to the firm gardner said hutton stands to gain fees of to mln dlrs from the transaction but sources close to the transaction said fees are at the low end of the scale it s a very complex transaction but basically what happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture any investment they might have once the merger takes place gardner said weinberger opposes fujitsu buying u s firm defense secretary caspar weinberger will join commerce secretary malcolm baldrige in fighting fujitsu ltd s itsu t plan to buy pct of fairchild semiconductor corp pentagon officials said he weinberger opposes it it is not in the best interests of the country to have more of the micro electronics business leaving the

government officials seeking to block the sale of a u s microchip maker to a japanese firm they appear to be linking completely unrelated issues shuichi takemoto of the foreign ministry s north american division told reuters u s commerce secretary malcolm baldrige has asked the white house to consider blocking the sale of fairchild semiconductor corp to japan s fujitsu ltd itsu t u s officials said yesterday baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the u s military dependent on a foreign company for vital high technology equipment pentagon officials said defence secretary caspar weinberger also opposes to the sale u s officials have also said the sale would give fujitsu a powerful role in the u s market for supercomputers while japan s supercomputer market remains closed to u s sales takemoto said national security should not be an issue since the planned purchase of fairchild from its current owner schlumberger ltd slb does not include fairchild s main defence related division in addition takemoto said tension over the supercomputer trade should not affect the sale as fairchild does not make supercomputers analysts noted that fairchild does make sophisticated microchips used in supercomputers fujitsu makes similar chips and supplies them to u s supercomputer makers they said takemoto also dismissed u s fears that the proposed takeover would violate u s antitrust law saying the purchase would not result in fujitsu monopolising the u s semiconductor market two separate issues appear to have come together to boost pressure to block the purchase industry analysts said the move is in part an attempt to force japan to open its domestic market to more u s supercomputer sales they said u s officials have repeatedly charged that the japanese public sector is closed to u s supercomputer sales despite u s firms technological lead in the field the united states believes japan will only react when bullied and this is a bullying ploy salomon brothers asia analyst carole ryavec said however the analysts said more is at stake than supercomputer sales as the u s fears it is losing its vital semiconductor industry to japanese competitors the real issue is xenophobia in the u s silicon valley said tom murtha of brokerage james capel and co u s japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has failed to subside despite recent efforts by japan s ministry of international trade and industry miti to get japanese firms to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing and opening japan s market a miti official said that while japan is faithfully abiding by the agreement problems remain in halting the sale of microchips in europe and southeast asia at prices below those set by the pact it is only a matter of time before we solve this problem he told reuters despite the furore fujitsu will proceed with talks on the acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with schlumberger last year a

schlumberger ltd most likely has an alternate buyer lined up for its fairchild semiconductor unit wall street analysts said i think its clear that in cancelling its agreement with fujitsu schlumberger has signaled that it has another deal in the works said paul johnson a semiconductor analyst with l f rothschild there are unquestionably other buyers out there added kidder peabody analyst adam f cuhney a lot of companies have looked at fairchild and would be willing to buy it among the companies that would be interested in bidding for fairchild are advanced micro devices amd sunnyvale calif and lsi logic corp llsi milpitas calif industry analysts said top u s chipmakers like national semiconductor corp nsm texas instruments inc txn and motorola inc mot might also seek to buy fairchild but could possibly run into antitrust problems the analysts added moreover fairchild s management is thought to be considering proposing a leveraged buyout of the cupertino calif company analysts said in a brief statement announcing the termination of the agreement with fujitsu schlumberger said the decision opened up other possibilities including a possible buyout by fairchild management the company said it ended the deal in which fujitsu would have bought pct of fairchild for an estimated mln dlrs because rising opposition to the deal by the reagan administration made it unlikely that the sale could be completed within a reasonable period of time analysts questioned this explanation however arguing that the companies did not need government approval to complete the transaction both schlumberger and fujitsu are foreigned owned companies schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because the u s government didn t want it said johnson of l f rothschild a spokesman for schlumberger declined to elaborate on the company s news release he said only that the company was reviewing a number of possible alternatives for the fairchild unit officials at fairchild and fujitsu were not immediately available for comment analysts noted the significance of the government s apparent success in preventing fujitsu from taking control of fairchild administration officials including commerce secretary malcolm baldrige and defense secretary caspar weinberger feared that the sale to fujitsu would lead to japanese control of key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military weapons systems the government really stood up for the semiconductor industry said johnson of l f rothschild that i think is the real significance of this consequently analysts said the

inc twa made the acknowledgement in a filing twa was required to make with the sec disclosing its pct stake in usair group the sec issued a formal order launching the private investigation on nov icahn said in the sec filing the order empowers sec investigators to try to find out whether any persons including icahn violated securities laws and related rules icahn said specifically the probe is examining the acquisition and subsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certain unspecified companies he said federal law requires individuals or groups of individuals who have made shareholder agreements to disclose stakes in companies of at least five pct within days icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed in connection with sec probes but this is the first time he has disclosed that he is among those being investigated by making the disclosure in a filing with the sec which is obviously already aware of its own probe icahn was also alerting current and potential shareholders of twa it is not uncommon for companies which are aware that they or their officers are the targets of government probes to acknowledge the existence of the otherwise secret investigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirements to their shareholders icahn said the sec is looking into whether he and others whom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring and selling more than five pct of a company s stock sec investigations into those kinds of possible securities law violations have been spawned by the agency s widening probe into the wall street insider trading scandal according to published reports making late filings of d forms which disclose the amount of stock over five pct an investor has in a company or making no filing at all could

to sell its fairchild semiconductor corp unit to fujitsu ltd sclumberger had said that controversy surrounding the venture made it unlikely the sale could be completed any time soon the sale was opposed by commerce and the u s defense department in part on national security grounds commerce chief spokesman b j cooper said the department had had no contact with schlumberger about the deal a defense department spokesman said the agency was unaware of schlumberger s announcement and would have no immediate reaction officials last week told reuters that commerce secretary malcolm baldrige

n decision to end an agreement in principle for fujitsu ltd itsu t to buy pct of its fairchild semiconductor corp and the political furore that surrounded the proposed sale will make japanese companies more cautious in their efforts to acquire u s high technology firms but will not halt such attempts industry analysts said the collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow to fujitsu but it will boost the cost of future u s expansion by the japanese firm said analysts polled by reuters the acquisition of fairchild is not essential to fujitsu s north american operations but it would have been a great boost james capel and co analyst tom murtha said french controlled schlumberger said yesterday it was ending the agreement because mounting political controversy in the u s made it unlikely that the sale of the fairchild stake could be completed in a reasonable time the sale was opposed by the u s commerce department and defence department partly on national security grounds fujitsu s acquisition of fairchild would have given the japanese computer maker control of a comprehensive north american sales and distribution system and access to microprocessor technology an area where fujitsu is weak analysts said the deal would also have given fujitsu additional microchip production facilities worldwide eight of them in the u s a report by the capel firm said it was an entry point a port for semiconductors and a marketing channel for other things said barclays de zoete wedd analyst rick may several analysts said the purchase would not have given fujitsu access to critical defence technology fairchild simply doesn t have key technology that s a thing of the past may said the failure could be a blessing in disguise for fujitsu as it might have had to spend several hundred million dollars to modernise fairchild s production lines capel s murtha said the failure of the deal will doubtless encourage japanese firms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire u s high tech firms but they are unlikely to stop analysts said most analysts said fujitsu was likely to go the more costly route of expanding its own production and distribution facilities in the u s although some said it could use the estimated mln dlrs set aside for buying fairchild to try to acquire some less politically symbolic firm it may slow the pace of japanese acquisitions but the necessity of expanding their production and design capacity in america remains said capel s murtha the japanese will continue to shop for bargains but it will be harder to find ones that are politically acceptable japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures or smaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlash that blocked the fairchild sale analysts said they re not going to slow up they re just going to buy smaller pieces because of the political risk said barclays de zoete s may several japanese firms have already taken to pct shares in smaller u s high technology firms such as super minicomputer makers he said opposition of the sort that blocked fujitsu could end up harming u s firms and undermining a trend toward multinational tie ups some analysts said this is not really of benefit to u s firms either said jardine fleming securities ltd analyst nick edwards the pooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move why should the government step in to prevent it japan s minister of international trade and industry hajime tamura told a press conference that interference by u s government officials in the fairchild deal was inappropriate this is entirely a private sector matter and not a matter for governments comment tamura said i think it was improper for u s government officials to intervene to the extent they did he said a spokesman told reuters the ministry s view is that international investment flows ought to be free and that such flows are of increasing importance in line with the growing closeness of u s japanese

s microchip maker which supplies components for supercomputers nomura securities co ltd nmsc t and daiwa securities co ltd dsec t japan s two largest brokerage firms are seeking a niche in the u s and european securities markets while the country s huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas banking the takeover specialists said major trading houses which see their profits evaporating in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade all have foreign businesses on their shopping lists among manufacturers car parts makers are under the most pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto makers they subcontract for as these move offshore the timing is favourable for japanese parties to buy up potential overseas businesses especially in the u s japan s largest market and where political risks are minimal a takeover specialist at one trading company said japanese companies have become among the world s richest after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed against the dollar by some pct in the past months but the yen s strength which has also raised the costs of japan s exports and allowed its asian neighbours to move into its traditional markets has frozen japanese corporate growth the specialists said looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more barriers against japanese exports japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work domestic interest rates now at record lows offer little investment opportunity japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous but the recent economic factors have become a driving force said a banking industry source so far though the japanese are being cautious while mergers and acquisitions among u s firms number in the thousands japanese buyouts of overseas companies have totalled just a few dozen one merchant banker said another merchant banker said that a flurry of japanese acquisition activity was originally expected five years from now but that time span appeared now to be too long japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now he said a turning point seemed to be

group for mln dlrs late last year after an earlier unsolicited bid for the whole company sun chemical refused to sell its entire business after learning that dainippon planned to liquidate all but its graphic arts related businesses hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon by the japanese the trading company official says japanese people don t like fighting they prefer peaceful amicable deals but now after some experience overseas japanese companies are acquainted with local practice he adds this is a healthy progression however the experts do not expect the japanese to run the board meetings of any giant u s or european concerns japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a large u s or european corporation one banker said they will expand their operations only gradually a typical way for japanese business a foreign merchant banker also noted there are not many mega deals left to do in the united states a lot of the big deals there have already been done but medium size and small concerns are potential targets of japanese companies the specialists said japanese will be aiming for new businesses in high technology areas japanese companies had used technology and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate from that trend one takeover specialist said many are watching the results of the first acquisitions if these succeed activity could build the specialists said but few such specialists are going to sit back and wait until the action begins already they said japanese trading houses long term credit and commercial banks

largely dominated by u s companies until this year company officials and analysts said state owned air canada takes over the country s second largest overnight courier business just two months after another canadian company onex capital corp ltd approved the acquisition of number one ranked purolator courier ltd from new jersey based purolator courier corp pcc but analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by financial restructuring undertaken by the u s parent companies and likely don t represent an industry trend toward buying out foreign owned courier operations it s a case of whether you can buy from the right people at the right time mcleod young weir ltd transportation analyst tony hine commented the two acquisitions fit with a larger move by u s companies embroiled in a take over or restructuring to sell off their canadian units to generate ready cash said nesbitt thomson deacon inc analyst harold wolkin there is a very good correlation between the u s parent selling canadian subsidiaries and the u s parent either being under siege or taking someone else over he said gelco corp of minnesota decided to sell gelco express ltd as part of its previously announced program to sell off four operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt gelco express marketing vice president james o neil told reuters the sale is the first under gelco s divestiture program and proceeds will be used to help pay down mln u s dlrs of debt by year end the company said while company officials declined to disclose earnings and revenue figures o neil said gelco express holds a dominant position in the industry handling more than packages a day and generating revenues of more than mln canadian dlrs a year the earlier move by purolator to sell its canadian unit formed an important part of a company restructuring program adopted after another canadian company unicorp canada corp acquired a pct stake in purolator and said it would consider acquiring the whole company last month purolator agreed to be acquired by a company formed by e f hutton lbo inc and certain managers of purolator s u s courier business for air canada its acquisition of gelco s canadian courier business represents an excellent financial investment in a market it sees growing by to pct annually spokesman esther szynkarsky said the airline also announced it acquired a pct stake in ems corp of calgary an in city messenger service it did not disclose financial terms but szynkarsky said the two acquisitions totalled about mln canadian dlrs and the two business have combined yearly revenues of mln dlrs she said the acquisition fit with air canada s strategy of seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline business gelco will continue to operate with current management independently of air canada although air canada already operates its own air cargo business that includes a small door to door courier operation they re well run they re a good investment they re doing well in a growing market and that s the way we want to keep it szynkarsky said analyst hine said the gelco and purolator canadian units will likely retain operating links with their u s delivery network generating traffic for the former parent companies without them having to tie up capital in canada the nature of the business is that incremental traffic is incremental revenue hine said it s sort of a sausage maker business where you put in place the sausage grinder and the more sausage you can stuff through the more money you make he added group reconsiders computer memories cmin bid a

of rainbow and progressive shares since the merger was announced the merger announced in february involves the formation of a new company astral pacific corp ltd which rainbow and progressive shareholders will enter into on a one for one share basis both boards have approved the merger bil has said it was the mystery bidder behind a recent stand in the market for three mln progressive shares we simply regard progressive enterprises shares to be worth approximately twice as much as rainbow shares and do not think the merger as proposed is soundly based bil chief executive paul collins said in an interview in the weekly national business review newspaper published today collins was not immediately available to respond directly to hawkins statement hawkins said the merger has been assessed by independent consultants and declared fair in all respects with benefits to all shareholders we are not going to stand by while other parties distort the picture for their own

called for an obligatory continuous rating for all swiss franc bonds and said he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a company should be made to declare their share in comments at a news conference of vontobel holding ag chairman hans vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks own self regulating bodies such as the swiss admissions board to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in a decline in the average quality of borrowers on the swiss franc market and a debate on the use of registered shares to prevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to the market with ratings from the major u s agencies which were readily available to professionals through specialised information systems we should make this classification obligatory and publish it in places that are easily accessible to lay people he said the quick changing nature of the financial market meant these ratings should also be continually updated he said vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies worried about takeovers increasingly issuing registered shares and participation certificates rather than bearer shares however both types of issue had a drawback he said the recent attempt by jacobs suchard ag jacz z to take over hero conserven lenzburg herz z had shown the limits of a pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someone who was not eligible according to the company s statutes excessive issue of participation certificates which do not carry voting rights would also be contrary to the principle of greater democracy in the new share law before parliament people buying for example more than five pct of a company s shares should be made to declare their purchase he said fleet flt

said the rumors were untrue however wendy s remained up at on volume of more than three mln shares several analysts were skeptical of the rumors yet they said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food restaurant chain was impossible wendy s declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds yet a wendy s spokesman said the company was aware of a business week article which named coke as a potential suitor and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill market sources mentioned anheuser busch inc bud and pepsico inc pep as alternatives to coke as acquirers neither of those companies would comment nor would the wendy s official it doesn t happen every day every week every month but its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies said denny lynch wendy s vice president of communications however lynch would not comment specifically on the current market rumors even before coke denied the rumors analysts had been skeptical of a takeover since atlanta based coke has stated it views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become a competitor to them i can t put another name on it said kidder peabody analyst jay freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up wendy s stock it very well could be someone s interested but freedman said he doesn t believe now is the right time for wendy s to be sold they re obviously having operational difficulties i ve always believed at the right price wendy s would consider an offer but i can t believe this is the right price at the right time freedman said if a transaction takes place the buyer s going to control the situation freedman said i just don t think there s anything going on i don t think it s worth much more than where it is said joseph doyle of smith barney analysts said wendy s

same store sales last year analysts said wendy s also fumbled when it introduced a high priced breakfast which it has since withdrawn analysts said some analysts said the company should be bringing in new products but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround there are analysts however who believe wendy s may be vulnerable to a takeover james murren of c j lawrence said wendy s could be worth to dlrs on a break up basis he said the company has improved its debt to equity ratio and wendy s owns a high percent of its own restaurants pct of they also have some attractive leaseholds on their restaurants murren said murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year wendy s real sales store for store turned upwards in the fourth quarter that was about the first time in seven quarters he said caroline levy of e f hutton also believes something could be going on with wendy s my gut feeling is something s going to happen i don t know what she said she estimated a takeover price would be at least dlrs per share one analyst speculated that coke became the rumored suitor because wendy s decided to sell coke at its fountains instead of pepsi wendy s is currently embroiled

several franchises some of which might compete against each other it used to be a chevrolet dealer was a chevrolet dealer now a chevrolet dealer might handle several lines jauppi says as dealers get bigger industry officials are talking about the possibility that some of them might become publicly owned or open international operations offering shares to the public is an option large dealers are obviously thinking of very seriously says cole although some say the franchise system might get in the way of a public offering jauppi says there are few obstacles to trading in car dealer shares dealers are large enough now to go public the only thing the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those cars it could happen any time jauppi says if you look at the whole merger mania and look at the scale some of these dealers it s going to be very hard to resist taking them public said another analyst and jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become international we re

securities firms should be more rigorous in restricting sensitive information on a need to know basis it said firms should train their employees to understand the need for confidentiality of market

southern remain largely unchanged from today onward we are willing even eager to make a fair market value offer in cash for the southern pacific said kansas city southern president and chief executive

l said it intended to make a tender offer for the pct of standard oil co srd n it does not already own at dlrs a share cash for a total of billion if the offer is fully accepted the offer would be made through its bp north america inc unit and was intended to commence not later than april the offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares being tendered bp said in a statement the dlr a share price was based on its own valuation as well as those of its financial advisers it took into account reviews of both public and non public information standard closed in new york last night at dlrs down dlrs bp shares dropped on the announcement to p from p at last night s close about a third of the cash payable would be met from bp s own resources the remainder would come from new borrowings partly from banks under a four year committed revolving credit facility and partly from a a new u s dlr commercial paper programme the company said it was in the course of arranging these facilities bp chairman sir peter walters said that the group s investment in standard was its largest single asset full ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be made without the limitations of a minority interest bp also believed the acquisition represented the optimum use of its financial resources it was confident oil prices were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the investment walters added that it also felt that due to management changes in standard could now operate successfully even in a lower oil price environment standard s net assets at end were billion dlrs and in the year it reported a loss of billion dlrs before tax and before an extraordinary item of mln dlrs analysts said that the move by bp had come as a surprise one noted that it was not immediately clear why the group should spend so much money buying a company it already controlled bp could also have bought up the remainder of standard shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago it was also unclear what effect the tender would have on the u k government s recent announcement that it intended to dispose of its remaining pct stake in bp sometime in the financial year analysts said analyst paul spedding of brokers kleinwort grieveson noted that any effect on the government sale of its stake in bp would depend on the reaction of the markets the deal would probably push bp s gearing up to around pct from pct currently he said however with the likelihood that oil prices would not repeat last year s rapid drop the prospects for standard returning to profitability this year and bp benefitting from its cash flow were good standard was a high cost oil producer the analysts noted spedding noted that it needed about dlrs a barrel to make money and at about dlrs a barrel revenue from production and its downstream activities would push it comfortably into surplus bp initially took a stake in standard following the discovery of oil in alaska s prudhoe bay in bp had inadequate distribution facilities in the u s while standard which was strong on marketing and refining was short on crude oil the analysts said that bp had promoted a major management reorganisation of standard in the past year the probability that much of the shake up at standard was now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the tender offer spedding said bp s willingness to take hard decisions such as major balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well received in the markets the lower costs that should now be possible especially after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come straight through to profits without being cut back by other sectors bp units seek five billion dlr revolving credit to support standard oil tender bp units seek five billion dlr revolving credit bp international and bp north america are seeking a five billion dlr four year syndicated credit facility in support of british petroleum co plc s tender offer for the pct of standard oil co it does not already own morgan guaranty trust co of new york said as arranger the facility to be guaranteed by british petroleum co plc bp l is probably the largest credit facility ever arranged in europe bond analysts said full terms will be announced either later today or tomorrow morning bp said earlier it planned a tender offer for the pct of standard it does not already own for dlrs a share cash the financing being arranged by morgan guaranty will take the form of a fully committed revolving credit as announced earlier bp also is arranging a u s commercial paper program in connection with the tender and part of the revolver will be used to support that program the exact size of the u s program has not been decided and the dealers have not yet been chosen the credit facility will also allow the borrower to issue cash advances with maturities of one three or six months through a tender panel which will be comprised of banks committed to the facility despite the unprecedented size of this euromarket facility morgan guaranty said that it was being syndicated only among bp s relationship banks as a result banks were being offered lead manager status at mln dlrs co lead management at mln and manager at mln although pricing on many credit facilities has become extremely fine in recent years because of the keen competition to win mandates morgan guaranty said banks would be compensated fairly since this is a special purpose facility

acquisition less than two months after first interstate bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy bankamerica corp chairman joseph pinola is still looking for a good buy but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought in a wide ranging interview pinola said he s looking for ways to improve profitability and capital between now and so as to resist any potential look at us to maintain our independence if possible in federal regulatory changes will allow the major east coast banks to buy banks in california first interstate the fourth largest california bank and the nineth largest nationwide owns banks in western states and has franchise operations in four additional states bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for large u s or foreign banks looking to quickly move into the lucrative california market and the west coast region while declining specifics on his corporate strategy when asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan pinola replied that s undoubtedly a fair statement it would be almost naive not to think that pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as opportunistic he said he will look for banks in management trouble that he can get at a bargain then add management to restore profitability or for banks in states where first interstate already operates then cut costs by combining resources the exception he said would be texas where he said most of the banks are already well managed but might be purchased at a discount because of the depressed regional economy pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move him to rekindle his bid for bankamerica saying only we continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of people continue to monitor and look at us banking analysts however consider another first interstate bid at bankamerica a long shot not likely to happen any time soon pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his billion dlr bid at the nation s second largest bank a very very difficult decision with that decision made however he acknowledged first interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number four position in the california banking community the competition in this state is tough he said noting citybank s recent purchase of financial service branches from sears roebuck company citybank is moving rapidly to move us down to fifth and wells fargo down to fourth he said outside california pinola acknowledged that security pacific corp with its recent acquisitions in arizona washington and oregon is quickly becoming a regional competitor in areas where first interstate has long dominated security is has been and continues to be a highly profitable and obviously well managed company he said he added however first interstate at the moment has the advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional banks a common name pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good financial condition first interstate continues to sustain serious loan losses in its rocky mountain states where energy real estate and agriculture dominate the economy asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked he said i don t think it has bottomed out because i think most of the problems are real estate related and the real estate problems are going to be with us for several years pinola said another failing economic sector agriculture in the midwest has slowed expansion of first interstate s franchise operation first interstate has franchise banks that offer first interstate financial services in ten states while a year ago he was considering taking his franchise operation east of the mississippi river pinola said because most of the franchise banks are now in the west expansion into the midwest must come first calling the franchise system moderately profitable pinola said it is going to take a rejuvenation of the agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed we were generating before the last year or two on the banking industry in general pinola said he thinks will be another bad year for loan losses with only banks with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits kodak ek buys stake in biotechnology company eastman kodak co said it has reached an agreement to acquire new stock representing a pct interest in industrial

heller urges broad reform to aid banking federal reserve board governor robert heller said the banking system could be strengthened by permitting formation of financial services holding companies involved in areas like banking insurance real estate and securities in a speech prepared for delivery in new york to the bank and financial analysts association heller said i believe that increased diversification along geographic and product lines is the key to strengthening the american banking system he said he supported the idea of financial services holding companies advocated by the association of bank holding companies in which regulation of various bank thrift insurance investment securities and real estate subsidiaries would be handled on functional lines limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the bank to the associated institutions and all transactions would have to be on an arms length basis heller said measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries heller said he would require the holding company to serve as a source of strength to the bank by making a commitment to maintain the bank s capital in other words the bank would not be allowed to fail as long as the holding company has a positive net worth heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted to own a financial services holding company again with the provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise if necessary heller said the effects of these actions would be banks that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them in which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to loot the bank was removed such diversification would give access to national and international financial services to corporations across the united states heller said that would mean the steady decline of america s banks in the world financial league tables would be arrested by permitting them to become more competitive gould gld sells french battery unit gould inc said it sold its french battery unit cie francaise d electro chimie to a group of investors including the unit s employees and

vigorously resist gaf corp s dlr per share takeover offer but the midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer either from gaf or its own management analysts believe analysts also said borg warner may attempt to escape gaf through a restructuring the speculation pushed borg warner s stock up to in heavy trading analysts predicted feisty gaf chairman samuel heyman will stage a tough campaign to gain control of borg warner so he can add its profitable plastics and chemical business to gaf it seems from at least their dealing with raider irwin jacobs that they don t want to be taken over the question is now do they acquiesce to gaf i think instinctively they want to remain independent said dudley heer of duff and phelps borg warner has been under siege by takeover speculation for almost a year last week jacobs investment vehicle minstar inc and an investor group sold its mln borg warner shares the same day gaf corp raised its stake by mln shares to pct of the outstanding jacobs was interested in buying the company but took no steps toward a transaction their borg warner policy has been to stonewall them for the last nine months it s been one of the dullest corporate battles i ve seen said one analyst the battle however has heated up and the range of breakup values on wall street span from the current market price to almost dlrs per share most analysts said they think a price in the low s would be appropriate arbitragers speculate that gaf will not give up easily on its billion dlr offer to buy the balance of borg warner analysts who know gaf predict heyman will either end up with borg warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials company in some other way heyman two years ago attempted an unsuccessful takeover of union carbide corp but gaf benefited from that company s restructuring borg warner can t quibble that it s not a legitimate offer it seems to me the short of it is borg warner is kind of between a rock and a hard place they either have to accept a dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it s sweetened i personally think the company is worth around dlrs per share said pershing analyst richard henderson henderson also speculated the company might attempt a restructuring such as the one carried out by goodyear tire and rubber co last year when it was being courted by sir james goldsmith the company bought back the financier s stock and carried out a wider share repurchase arbitragers however said they do not believe heyman is seeking greenmail or the repurchase of his stock by the company at a premium analysts noted that heyman seems to have no problems with financing the transaction previously associated with junk bond experts drexel burnham lambert inc gaf said it would finance its borg warner takeover with bank financing gaf said it would make a tender offer following a merger agreement approved by the borg warner board and conditioned on the board s recommendation of the tender offer and merger heyman said in a letter to borg warner that he expects a merger would provide job security for borg warner employees since the two companies businesses overlap analysts however believe heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay debt from the transaction gaf s stock rose today to i believe obviously if gaf takes over borg warner at the level it is proposing it

emery has shown the courage to go forth said one arbitrager who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as bidders it makes sense said james parker of robinson humphrey but it won t make out as well as they think they won t get a pct of the synergies analysts said the acquisition could cost emery earnings in the short term but long term after eliminating redundancies and selling other

express corp fdx which has pct of the market parker speculated that the combined emery purolator would have about pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery business this will make emery a bigger

with hutton was also called into question by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week which attempted to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth hearings in a new york state court were delayed until monday arbitragers had said they believed the hutton offer could be bettered because the wall street firm was not planning to keep its cash tied up in purolator hutton is

to billion marks in from a comparable billion in including a rise to billion from billion in bank participations herrhausen said the grouping of holdings in the balance sheet in this was was not a first step to floating them off in a separate holding company c and w offered role in new japan telecom company a japanese businessman announced plans for a new telecommunications firm in which britain s cable and wireless plc would be a core company however the plan unveiled by senior federation of economic organizations official fumio watanabe does not specify what stake cable and wireless would have the share holdings of the core companies should be equal watanabe said in a statement the actual percentage of shareholdings should be agreed by the core companies he said the eight core companies will provide directors for the firm the new company shall immediately set to work on the feasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself watanabe said watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups one of which included c and w seeking to compete against kokusai denshin denwa co ltd which now monopolizes japan s overseas telephone business the post and telecommunications ministry has said it wants only one competitor to kdd and has backed watanabe s efforts a british source who declined to be identified further said the proposals could open the door to further talks between c and w cawl l and the other firms involved c and w had earlier rejected a reported proposal which would have given it a five pct share in the new telecommunications firm compared to the less than three pct stake watanabe originally proposed c and w has a pct stake in one of the two firms watanabe has proposed should merge the british source said the decision not to specify the exact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the door open for further discussion it s probably a sensible approach on their part the british source told reuters c and w has also been pushing hard for permission to lay a new cable between japan and the u s the proposed merger has sparked an international row with british government sources threatening retaliatory action against japan for what they see as discriminatory practices against foreign firms the sources said last friday that one option for britain would be to revoke licenses of japanese banks and securities companies operating in london the u s has also attacked the original merger plans saying that both rival consortia should be licensed asked about participation by other u s and european firms watanabe said they will not be core companies but if they wish they could participate under the japanese law total foreign participation would be limited to one third it might be wise for c and w to join the new firm which has the support of many influential backers and work within this for the realization of their ideas watanabe told reporters the other core firms are mitsubishi corp mitt t mitsui and co mits t sumitomo corp sumt t matsushita electric industrial co mc t toyota motor corp toyo t c itoh and co citt t and pacific telesis international inc watanabe said that his latest proposal represented his final effort if it fails to satisfy the british government it will be up to the japanese government to explain its position he said guinness to sell retail interests guinness plc guin l said that as part of a new strategy for the company it will be selling its retail interests to concentrate resources on developing its international beverage businesses among the firms to be sold are martin s and gordon

offered a price of pesos per share for the block held in trust by the ucpb it looks good diaz said but he added several issues including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares had to be resolved before the pcgg gave its approval to the sale the pcgg s sequestration last year of mln shares aborted smc s bid to buy them back from trading companies in the ucpb group the commission said it suspected the shares were actually controlled by eduardo cojuangco an associate of former president ferdinand marcos cojuango who headed the boards of both smc and ucpb when he fled last year after marcos was toppled personally owned mln shares in smc his holdings are also under sequestration the shares that smc now proposes to buy from the ucpb are owned by mln coconut farmers diaz said naturally we do not want them to go back into the hands of marcos cronies pcgg sources said a compromise would end a row over a down payment of mln pesos made by smc s hong kong subsidiary neptunia corp ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year the ucpb had said the mln peso payment would be forfeited because smc chairman andres soriano iii had failed to fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally negotiated price of billion pesos pcgg sources said smc the philippines largest food and beverage manufacturer has agreed to sell mln b class shares from the mln shares to australian brewer alan bond at a price of pesos per share the pcgg sources said of the proposed billion peso transaction billion pesos would be offset against the mln peso down payment the mln pesos worth of preferred shares in ucpb held by smc mln pesos in uncollected dividends on the ucpb shares and mln pesos advanced to ucpb controlled trading companies the ucpb rejected an original offer of pesos per share made by smc for mln shares which grew to mln after a pct stock dividend declared in june last year a spokesman for smc said the company s member board met today to discuss the proposed compromise the spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board meeting saying the dispute was under arbitration president corazon aquino last month asked smc and ucpb to set up a three man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership issue the panel is due to submit its report by april eduardo de los angeles a government nominee in the smc board filed a formal complaint before the

announcement of proposals made earlier this week and reported in the japanese press cable has a pct stake in one of the two groups trying to compete against japan s kokusai denshin denwa co ltd which

which has accumulated almost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroad conglomerate analysts said takeover speculation has surrounded santa fe since henley disclosed its stake in the company earlier this week but analysts and a santa fe official were skeptical a takeover is its intention analysts also said the company has strong defenses that would easily deter any suitor one of those being its problems combining its two railroad properties which hang in regulatory limbo richard fischer of merrill lynch and co inc said that santa fe at december had mln dlrs in cash and cash equivalents while its long term debt to capital was just over pct this gives them plenty of borrowing power he said which could be used against an unwanted suitor henley group s chairman michael dingman has said he wants to take major positions in undervalued natural resource companies he also told reuters in an interview he is seeking an acquisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs santa fe officials don t appear concerned that henley might launch a takeover i would not characterize the atmosphere around here as one of concern one santa fe executive said about henley i think it s wrong to assume dingman has formed a firm strategy with santa fe said mark hassenberg who covers henley for dlj securities analysts say the potential of santa fe s land assets are likely to be realized slowly they add that santa fe s efforts to merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeable future these realities they said support the henley group s statement that its santa fe stake is only an investment the more pressing problem facing santa fe is overcoming difficulties in merging its two railroads the atchison topeka and santa fe railway co and southern pacific transportation co the merger would create the nation s second longest railroad last july the interstate commerce commission icc denied the merger on anticompetitive grounds the company since has granted trackage sharing rights to four western railroads to meet the icc s concerns and persuade it to reopen the hearings in its three year old struggle to merge the lines my guess is the commission will decide in three to six weeks whether to reopen hearings fischer said i believe they ve made an effort to satisfy the icc s objections he said but in doing so they haven t pleased everyone before they had burlington northern on their side now burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are set up if the hearings are reopened analysts predicted it will take six to nine months for everyone to have their say and up to another year for the icc to decide santa fe is in the midst of a mln share stock buyback program begun in it has bought back mln shares as of february when it had mln shares outstanding a spokesman said among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned by norfolk southern one of mln shares bought in and another of mln shares in one analyst said james voytko at paine webber believes santa fe could fight off the henley group with its cash and credit citing the share buybacks from norfolk southern he said one of santa fe s options if threatened could be to buy the henley stake it is indeed possible that dingman sees this as a low risk opportunistic investment voytko said people who follow santa fe have given me values of dlrs to dlrs a share said dlj securities hassenberg but i m certain that in dingman s mind the company is worth more than that in breakup value pioneer sugar says csr takeover offer too low

third parties interested in an acquisition it said sec clarifies position on tender offer changes the securities and exchange commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for the shares of companies that they must extend the period their offers are open if key conditions are changed specifically the agency said those making tender offers for companies stock must extend the offers if they decide to eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be tendered in order for the offers to be valid tender offers typically include minimum share conditions as a result a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached in an interpretation of current rules which officials said clarifies the sec s present position the agency said a tender offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so the interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share condition is a material change of the tender offer under u s securities law sec officials said the sec has already said that other specific material changes such as changes in the percentage of securities being sought or the price being offered made during the course of a tender offer require a day extension of the offer the length of the extension which is aimed at giving shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender offer was not specified in cases where the minimum share conditions were waived sec officials said the length of the extension in such cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case but would generally be between five and days the agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each offer denying shareholders the chance to react to the new information officials declined to identify the two offers if a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of its offer it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate dissemination the sec said federal securities law requires that all tender offers remain open for at least business days gencorp gy
