brazil anti inflation plan limps to anniversary inflation plan initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the economy is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring prices widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis announced last february the plan froze prices fixed the value of the new cruzado currency and ended widespread indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country s pct inflation rate but within a year the plan has all but collapsed the situation now is worse than it was although there was inflation at least the economy worked a leading bank economist said the crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account in and brazil s annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to cover the billion dlrs needed to service its billion dlr foreign debt for the first nine months of all seemed to be on target for a repeat with monthly surpluses averaging one billion dlrs but as exports were diverted and imports increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus plunged to mln dlrs in october and since then has averaged under mln  japan february interim trade surplus jumps japan s customs cleared

trade sanctions against south africa prime minister ingvar calrsson said carlsson told a news conference the party decided the fight against apartheid took priority over sweden s traditional policy of only adopting sanctions with the backing of the u n security council the government will decide later what form the trade boycott will take and when it will come into force  japan u s set to begin high level trade talks japan and the u s kick off top level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other the talks held annually at sub cabinet level to review the whole gamut of u s japan economic relations will pave the way for american secretary of state george schultz s one day stop over here at end week on his way home from china faced with growing congressional protectionist pressure the u s administration is pressing japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus u s officials said we appreciate their frustration a senior japanese government official said but we are also frustrated the official said the pct rise of the yen over the last months has hit japan hard forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad that has not yet shown up in dollar based statistics on trade but it will he said he said the u s administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with congress it would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments a senior u s official replied the talks begin tomorrow with high level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance which last year amounted to billion dlrs in japan s favour on the following two days the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt to such bilateral trade problems as super computers the structural talks are intended to be free wheeling discussions among senior officials tomorrow s topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing and the implications of government budget deficits these talks come at a particularly delicate time for the japanese government which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more some u s officials complained japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports as washington wants japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge u s budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance that budget deficit has meant that the u s is buying more imports japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices it condemns japan without due process one japanese official said that reference spoils what is otherwise a well thought out bill introduced by democratic senator lloyd bentsen he said japan is also not totally happy with the administration s trade bill particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the u s officials said nevertheless japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them we have no leverage one official admitted as a result tokyo is striving to meet u s complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields including super computers the u s is pressing for greater access to the japanese super computer market the japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers officials said  taiwan plans new tariff cuts taiwan plans another round of deep tariff cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the u s a senior economic planner said wang chao ming vice chairman of the council for economic planning and development told s taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on products sometime in the second half of this year cuts of up to pct on those items were made last year and wang said further cuts would go much deeper we have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially he said the united states taiwan s main trading partner has said the island s import tariffs still ranging from a high of almost pct were unacceptable it has criticised the cuts as too selective taiwan s trade surplus with the united states hit billion dlrs last year the surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to billion dlrs which wang said made taiwan a target for u s protectionism wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened taiwan s position in talks with washington over export quotas particularly for shoes textiles and machine tools which are among the island s main export earners a special taiwanese trade delegation leaves for washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of taiwan textiles under the accord taiwan s textile export growth was limited to pct each year until taipei has said it is losing markets to south korea and hong kong which were given more generous terms  talks show new canadian confidence group says canada s decision to raise the issue of a free trade pact with the u s was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of canadian self confidence a public policy study group said it suggests the canada of the immediate post war period when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world the washington based atlantic council said u s and canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries the world s biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments of about billion dlrs annually the council s study said the trade talks with a deadline of october for an agreement are the biggest issue in u s canadian relations the study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties the council said in the past most canadians have shied away from the notion of a free trade arrangement fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country times their size in population but at the same time it added canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world the council said that in the talks canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of u s duties against allegedly subsidized exports a recent example was the per cent duty the u s imposed on canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized the council said the chief u s concerns included ending curbs against u s banking insurance telecommunications and the so called cultural industries publishing broadcasting and films it said other major u s canadian issues were defense cooperation acid rain and the u s rejection of a canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the northwest passage  japan moves to tighten chip export curbs the ministry of international trade and industry miti acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the u s to preserve a u s japan pact on semiconductor trade but major japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness a miti spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters trading houses applying for a miti export licence will be required to show such a certificate but those without it will not automatically be denied licences he said but some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak u s government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the july agreement japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey market sales by third party brokers who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for japanese makers under the agreement the miti spokesman said if the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means in that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure miti earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by pct in first quarter spokesmen for the firms said but they doubt the usefulness of the latest move as long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money a hitachi ltd hit t spokesman said  swiss capital exports rise in january swiss capital exports rose to billion francs in january

united states to remove curbs on its exports to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology but the u s embassy replied that chinese figures showing years of trade deficits with the u s out of the last are inaccurate and said peking itself would have to persuade congress to change laws which limit its exports the official international business newspaper today published china s demands in a editorial to coincide with the visit of u s secretary of state george shultz it is extremely important that the u s market reduce its restrictions on chinese imports provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand chinese exports the editorial said the u s should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for chinese goods and admit china into the generalised system of preference gsp despite easing of curbs on u s technology exports in recent years control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries it added the paper also printed an article by china s commercial counsellor in its washington embassy chen shibiao who said that all kinds of difficulties and restrictions were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential he named them as u s protectionist behaviour curbs on technology transfer and out of date trade legislation the paper also printed a table showing that since bilateral trade began in china has had a deficit every year except and it shows the and deficits at billion and billion dlrs a u s embassy official said the u s did not accept peking s trade figures at all mainly because they exclude goods shipped to hong kong and then trans shipped to u s while u s figures are based on country of origin he said that if china wants to obtain gsp status it will have to lobby congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent peking getting such status the u s trade act of says that to qualify for gsp china must be a member of the general agreement of tariffs and trade gatt for which it applied in july and not be dominated or controlled by international communism the official said china was well aware of the laws some of which date to the anti communist early s but that there is not sufficient political will in the u s to change them china has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti dumping in the u s within the last two years which the u s side won he said but for the first time china signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods which may lead the u s side to withdraw the anti dumping case he added another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in peking s application to gatt china has the potential to disrupt world markets especially in textiles other gatt countries will be nervous about china in this respect but there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in gatt the diplomat said poland czechoslovakia hungary and romania are members of gatt but none has china s massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports in a speech today in the northeast city of dalian u s secretary of state george shultz said his country welcomed china s interest in participating in gatt the process of chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight the gatt rules were not designed for a large economy of the chinese type shultz said china can play an important role by actively joining gatt discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide china can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its gatt participation he said the problems facing u s china trade and gatt membership are similar a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs especially for exports and a de facto dual currency system in a memorandum backing its application presented to gatt last month china said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with guidance planning and economic levers the diplomat said that to join gatt china had much to do  u s asks japan end agriculture import controls the u s wants japan to eliminate import controls on agricultural products within three years visiting u s under secretary of state for economic affairs allen wallis told eishiro saito chairman of the federation of economic organisations keidanren a spokesman for keidanren said the spokesman quoted wallis as saying drastic measures would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by congress wallis who is attending a sub cabinet level bilateral trade meeting made the remark yesterday in talks with saito wallis was quoted as saying the reagan administration wants japanese cooperation so the white house can ensure any u s trade bill is a moderate one rather than containing retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country he was also quoted as saying the u s would be pleased were japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three the spokesman said japan currently restricts imports of agricultural products a ban on rice imports triggered recent u s complaints about japan s agricultural policy  china calls for better trade deal with u s china

trade legislation  belgian says ec would react to textile bill belgian foreign trade minister herman de croo said if congress passed legislation curbing world textile imports the only way the european community ec could react was to retaliate de croo said at a news conference if you limit textile imports you will re orient textiles to europe and that he said would trigger ec taxes on u s goods congress passed a textile bill two years ago but it was vetoed by president reagan on grounds that curbing imports to protect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliation u s trading partners a similar bill has been introducted this year in a congress with a bigger democratic majority and with a president weakened by the iran scandal de croo here for talks with administration officials and congressmen said if a textile bill passed the only way we could react would be retaliation and it would cause more retaliation which is not a good way to deal with problems he said if a textile bill was enacted we will impose taxes on a lot of american products he said it would be stupid we have to avoid that he said congressmen seem upset mosty with japan because of its massive trade suprlus with the united states and not with ec nations but ec nations will be hurt by the diverted shipments of asian textiles de croo also criticized the way u s officials try to solve ec trade issues saying each time we come in contact it a conflict contact the clouts are coming fom the west he said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross the atlantic and dramatized with headlines this is not the way to work in a serious way between two big powers de croo said  rostenkowski says he will oppose protectionist trade bill in u s house rostenkowski opposes protectionist trade bill house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski said congress must avoid a temptation to pass a protectionist trade bill this year in remarks prepared for delivery before the national press club rostenkowski d ill predicted major trade legislation will be sent to president reagan by the end of this year but he warned that his conciliatory message on the trade bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn other countries their access to the american market would be curtailed unless they opened their markets to u s goods complaints about foreign trade restraints are not a smoke screen for protectionism they a plea for fairness rostenkowski said it is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the american market he added however he said there would likely be changes in the market access proposal from the plan which cleared the house last year that plan would have set a specific time table for foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face a pct cut in exports to the united states  u k exports body gets new executive director export credits guarantee department has named malcolm stephens director of export finance at barclay s bank plc and a former career civil servant at ecgd for years to the post of executive director a department spokesman said stephens replaces jack gill who is retiring early aged a drop in the ecgd s business volume and a rise in its debt to the exchequer have led to criticism in parliament in recent years stephens said the fall in business volume was a top convern adding that the department may have to compete more aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar services the department s annual report for the year ended march showed exports insured by the department fell to billion stg from billion the year before while its debt to the exchequer almost doubled to mln stg stephens said he had no specific list of changes but among his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports the agency will have to review its policies on insuring export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis he said large lump political risk insurance is the sort of thing we want to take a look at you have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing stephens said in response to a qustion about whether ecgd will strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance recipients he noted that certain countries have already been removed from the list  rostenkowski reluctant to back tax hike house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back the tax increase if it did not have president reagan s support he told a national press club luncheon there would be a number of tax proposals that could be debated if reagan sought a tax increase to help balance the budget however he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates enacted in last year s tax reform bill unchanged there have been calls in congress to hold the rates at the level rather than allow them to fall next year reagan proposed billion dlrs in revenue as part of his budget proposal but it did not include general tax increases on trade issues rostenkowski said he did not expect the major trade bill this year would single out any u s industry for special protection to go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide he said this apparently ruled out congressional approval of another textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports as was proposed again this year  u s wine exports rose per cent last year exports of american wine rose per cent last year to a total of million gallons the wine institute said the san francisco based promotional group said per cent of the exported wine was from california and the top three markets were canada japan and britain japan which edged out britain as the leading importer of american wines in continued in second place canadian imports rose per cent to million gallons japan per cent to million gallons and britain per cent to gallons a spokesman for the institute said the declining value of the dollar and strong promotional efforts on the part of the california wine industry contributed significantly to the increased shipments the wine exports were valued at mln dlrs up from mln dlrs the previous year  u s senate panel could consider trade measure the u s senate agriculture committee may take up a bill tomorrow that would strengthen the activities of u s agricultural trade teams in selected developing countries committee staff said the measure sponsored by committee chairman patrick leahy d vt and sen john melcher d mont would establish trade teams of between six and nine persons drawn from federal agencies and private voluntary organizations staff said the trade missions would seek to generate interest in the u s government s food donation and commercial programs pl section export credit and export enhancement and upon return be required to advocate extension of concessional or commercial benefits to interested countries the trade teams would be made up of representatives of the u s agriculture department state department the agency for international development and private voluntary organizations such as u s wheat associates the bill would require teams within six months to visit seven countries mexico philippines indonesia india bangladesh senegal and nigeria within one year after passage of the measure another eight countries would have to be visited peru kenya the dominican republic costa rica malaysia venezuela tunisia and morocco other countries could be added to the list senate staff members said the bill still in the drafting stages had broad support and was expected to be approved by the committee tomorrow  spain to launch export drive spain unveils a billion peseta plan this month aimed at boosting exports to reach european community levels director general of the infe export institute apolonio ruiz ligero said the target is to raise exports to pct of gross domestic product over the next four years compared to pct now he said this is the minimum prevailing level in the ec and there is no reason why we should lag behind countries like italy which have a similar productive structure he said the plan calls for providing soft loans tax cuts and other fiscal benefits to exporters and raising spain s presence in international trade fairs consumer goods such as fashion and wine as well as traditional industrial exports will be promoted ruiz ligero said infe would double its annual budget to billion pesetas to finance the four year plan while the government s development aid fund fad would provide a special billion peseta grant the plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in real terms this year after a pct decline last year ruiz ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand which rose six pct last year after pct in he added that pct of spain s exports went to organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd countries the ec accounts for pct of the market and exports to the community rose seven pct last year the government plans to concentrate efforts on western europe and the u s the problem is convincing businessmen that exports are vital to survival in the context of ec competition he said he said spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand while turning their backs on foreign markets they have to realise their share of the home market is going to shrink with growing deregulation he said foreign companies are taking up positions in the domestic economy and it is it vital to secure a market share abroad  baldrige concerned about korean taiwan deficits secretary of commerce malcolm baldrige expressed concern about the continuing u s trade deficits with south korea and taiwan and said that without an adjustment in exchange rates there is little likelihood of improvement speaking to the president s export council an industry advisory group baldrige said the trade deficit issue was under discussion with those countries i feel that unless we see an exchange rate adjustment we probably won t be able to see much of a change in the large surplus that taiwan in particular has with us he said in a wide ranging discussion on u s trade matters baldrige also repeated u s concern about an attempted takeover by japan s fujitsu company of fairchild computer he said that the japanese were resisting allowing u s companies into the giant computer business while at the same time attempting to acquire control of a u s company that does major computer business in the u s market lastly baldrige said that the united states was hopeful that it could complete a free market agreement with canada by the autumn but said major issues including acid rain remained unresolved  ec appoints new trade chief the european community commission today appointed its chief spokesman hugo paemen as its top official in charge of multilateral trade negotiations a commission spokesman said paemen a belgian official who had previously been chief aide to former external affairs commissioner etienne davignon has been in his post since january the spokesman said paemen will continue as chief spokesman until the retirement on may of paul luyten who is now in charge of ec departments handling negotiations in the world trade body gatt the oecd and other forums  s korean trade surplus with u s seen falling south korea s record billion dlrs trade surplus with the u s is bound to diminish as the country switches purchases from japan in favor of u s companies trade minister woong bae rha said he rejected suggestions the korean won is undervalued and denied any plans for a drastic and sudden revaluation rha is heading a trade mission to u s cities last year south korea ran a billion dlr trade surplus including a record billion surplus with the u s and a billion dlr deficit with japan rha told s in an interview the current trade mission is looking for billion dlrs in purchases from u s companies about a quarter of which represents transferred purchases from japanese sources rha said the items being sought by the current mission are mainly chemicals machinery and parts he said south korea is the fourth largest importer of u s agricultural products the current mission is not involved in that area but there are plans to buy substantial amounts of cotton from the u s he noted his country is clearly not as open as the american market nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be considering south korea has a billion dlr foreign debt and spends six pct of its gross national product on defense  gatt council defers decision on semiconductors the ruling gatt council deferred a decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a european community complaint against the u s japanese agreement on exports of computer semiconductors david woods spokesman of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt told a news briefing that the main parties would continue bilateral talks this was in the hope of resolving the row before the next council meeting on april the five year accord signed in july aims to protect the u s market from dumping of low price japanese microchips officially known as semiconductors the e c complained the accord breached gatt trade rules by allowing tokyo to monitor prices allowing it to set minimum prices for japanese chips sold in third countries the nation community also charged the agreement gave u s producers preferential access to the japanese market woods said many nations hong kong canada switzerland singapore sweden malaysia and nigeria had supported the ec complaint during the heated council debate japan s delegate minoru endo and u s ambassador michael samuels replied in the debate that the e c charges were unfounded but they were willing to continue bilateral talks  gatt sets up dispute panel on canadian herring the ruling gatt council set up a formal dispute panel to examine a u s complaint that a canadian law prohibiting export of unprocessed herring and salmon was discriminatory david wood official spokesman of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt told a news briefing the decision was taken after bilateral consultations failed to resolve the row u s ambassador michael samuels charged during the council debate that canada was trying to preserve domestic jobs by insisting that herring and salmon be processed at home robert white canada s deputy chief of delegation replied the law was in line with gatt rules and was for conservations reasons but he agreed to setting up the dispute panel  british aide criticizes u s protectionism a senior british official said that protectionist bills being considered by congress could trigger retaliation by the european community eec and threaten the global trading system paul channon secretary for trade and industry said if congress passed legislation to curb textile imports which would hit ec shipments as well as shipments from major asian textile producers the community would have to retaliate his comments echoed those made yesterday by belgian trade minister herman de croo who said if the bill passed the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on u s exports channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with reagan administration officials and members of congress de croo was also in washington for trade talks channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in congress since his visit here last year as congress and the administration tried to find ways to reduce the u s trade deficit which last year hit a record billion dlrs channon also called for greater ec u s cooperation to force japan to open its markets to foreign goods channon said japan s trade surplus is causing everyone problems its surplus with the united states last year was billion dlrs and with ec nations billion dlrs the more united pressure there could be the better he said channon also called for increased u s ec cooperation to avoid trade disputes he said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost grains sales when spain and portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to ec standards but if both sides drew back from the brink that time he said it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion channon added that there is increasing reesentment in europe over the u s tactic of negotiating under the pressure of unilaterally imposed deadlines he said other potential conflicts are already in sight alleged european government subsidies of airbus aircraft and taxes on fats and oils and the commuity and the united states must therefore learn to manage their relations better he said another bill to let the united states retaliate against a nation if that nation s market was not open to u s goods would bypass the trade pact gatt general agreeeement on tariffs and trade as an arbiter of trade practices he said foreign trade law should be judged by gatt and not by the united states adding if the trade law is to be interpreted by the united states and not by the gatt what is to happen to the rest of us  yeutter plans trade trip to china this summer u s trade representative clayton yeutter said he plans a july trip to china to discuss trade issues including china s admission to the general agreements on tariffs and trade yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible china could be a member of gatt before the end of the year they are making major moves to becoming a full scale member of the world economy he told the house appropriations subcommittee which oversees his agency s budget depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of china s gatt membership yeutter said he could put the final touches on the u s part of the agreement during his trip the admission of china to gatt which is the multinational group of nations which negotiates international rules on trade would offer both potential export markets and potential competition for u s industries he said that has a lot of potential as well as risks for u s business yeutter said i think china will develop into a fine market for us he added  yeutter concerned about u s export picture u s trade representative clayton yeutter said he expects imports to fall soon but he was concerned about the lack of improvement in u s exports given the dollar s decline in the last months i m convinced we re about to see an improvement on the import side i m more concerned about the export side he told a house appropriations subcommittee part of the blame goes on other countries which have not generated the economic growth to increase demand for u s goods and part to some u s companies which are not generating competitive exports he said  house trade bill drafting postponed the house ways and means trade subcommittee postponed until next week its opening session to start drafting major changes to u s trade laws a committee aide said the subcommittee had not yet completed the preparatory work to start writing the legislation the aide said  belgolux trade moves into surplus in the belgo luxembourg economic union bleu moved into a narrow trade surplus of billion francs in after a billion franc deficit in figures given by a spokesman for the national statistics institute show he said imports fell last year to billion francs from in while exports were also lower at billion francs against billion in december the bleu had an billion franc trade surplus after a billion franc surplus in november and a billion franc surplus in december  u s tells japan to do more to cut trade surplus u s undersecretary of state for economic affairs allen wallis said he had urged japan to do much more to reduce its large trade surplus with the united states our central message to japan this week was that while we have made progress in some areas much needs to be done he told a press conference after three days of talks what we need is a resolution of trade issues we need visible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage more imports and we need greater domestic led growth forecasting sluggish economic growth in japan this year wallis urged tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduce its trade surplus which hit a record billion dlrs in he named several areas of particular concern to washington computer microchips supercomputers kansai airport agricultural products and car telephones he warned that the u s japan agreement governing trade in semiconductors was in jeopardy despite the pact japanese producers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets other than the united states while u s penetration of the japanese market has not increased he said  economic spotlight polish sanctions poland says u s sanctions have cost its economy billion dlrs and has made clear it wants washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses some of them are too sophisticated to convert into financial terms one banking source said but western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate they say it is blurred by the poor performance of poland s economy and dismiss the billion dlr figure as illusory sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under achieving they did have a bad effect yes but they only contributed to largely internal economic problems one said the u s imposed the measures and withdrew most favoured nation mfn trading status from poland in in retaliation for suppression of the solidarity free trade union under martial law the estimated cost to the polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the institute of national economy an offshoot of the central planning commission according to one western envoy an expert on polish economic affairs it extrapolated information on growth trends in trade with the united states as well as increases in credits from western commercial and government lenders but the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely he said dismissing the estimate as a theoretical projection based on a high point which has no real scientific evaluation a foreign trade ministry official said polish exports to the u s in the late s averaged around mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed imports have suffered slumping from around mln dlrs to mln as credits ran out poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the west last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted billion official figures show acknowledging that sanctions have lost poland important u s markets including agricultural equipment textiles chemicals and some foodstuffs western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons poland is accusing the west of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons said one expert it s an illusion based on a misunderstanding of western economy there s a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it another said adding that poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the s which were no longer today s reality describing the billion dlr assessment as nebulous one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new mfn status will have little impact on poland which has a hard currency debt of billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry mfn doesn t really mean anything only that poland will not be treated worse than other countries it will be difficult to regain access to the u s market because different forces are in play now said one western envoy he said polish products were not competitive and their quality was too low trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the u s japan and europe would also hamper poland s efforts to regain entry deputy foreign trade minister janusz kaczurba recognised this fact recently kaczurba told the official pap news agency recently making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult and in certain cases impossible in a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about mln dlrs while poland is unlikely to seek compensation it says it has a moral right to assistance from the u s which it says imposed the sanctions illegally but a western economist said the argument that u s sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the polish economy won t cut any ice the americans will just reply that the poles acted immorally in crushing solidarity nevertheless polish national bank head wladyslaw baka in talks in washington last week with the international monetary fund imf and world bank made it clear that poland was looking for a lead from the united states he was quoted by pap as saying that poland would meet its financial obligations to the united states but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners he stressed that the u s had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of poland s partners interested in the settlement of polish debt putting it more sharply one senior banking official blamed washington for obstructing talks with the world bank imf and paris club of western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role as a major superpower the united states can influence international organisations he said citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which western nations were prepared to cooperate  yeutter says u s budget deficit reduction key to trade deficit solution consensus builds for world agricultural reform top u s and european farm trade and government representatives called for a sweeping reform of world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply imbalance speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here demonstrated a growing u s european consensus on the need for an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and production it is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and harmony into the world agricultural trade if not the disruptions in markets may grow even more severe the walls of protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation become more harmful u s department of agriculture deputy administrator william bailey said bailey said his attendance at the two day meeting which ends tomorrow demonstrated the u s recognises the need to adjust its policies to the changing market environment the need for urgent reforms is justified by the imbalance and tensions of the world economy the secretary general of the organisation for economic cooperation and development jean claude paye said and the forum for such a reform is the general agreement on tariffs and trade he noted paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures to help farmers in unprofitable areas another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm prices allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand and instead help farmers through income support and adjustment aids proposed james howard executive vice president of cargill usa one of the world s largest cereal houses franz josef feiter agricultural adviser to west german chancellor helmut kohl agreed the european community must take greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices however differentiated policy treatment is required to take account of large disparities in the situation around the ec he said agriculture is an efficient sector of the european economy and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the community he said  france yugoslavia commission to boost trade france and yugoslavia agreed to set up a joint economic commission as part of efforts to promote commercial links and industrial cooperation between the two countries the french finance ministry said the commission to be composed of businessmen was agreed during talks between foreign trade minister michel noir and yugoslavian minister without portfolio egon padovan a ministry statement said both sides had agreed on the need to

little over the past two years  baker says g pact just a start treasury secretary james baker said the agreement among industrial nations in paris last month is only a start in washington s drive to intensify economic cooperation among leading countries in a speech to the national newspaper association baker said the six steps beginning with the plaza agreement and culminating in the paris accord are only a start he added we see our role as a steward of a process in which we sit down with our industrial allies to find ways to promote more balanced international growth the paris agreements called trade surplus countries to strengthen their growth and on the u s to reduce its budget deficit under such circumstances the countries agreed their currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals baker also said he still sees ominous signs of pressure for protectionist trade legislation and this pressure for protectionism is coming from new areas of society but he also said he believed a coalition was forming that supported free trade  treasury s baker forecasts reduction in japanese trade surplus this year baker sees lower japanese trade surplus u s treasury secretary james baker said the japanese trade surplus would begin to decline this year he told the national newspaper association you re going to see a reduction in the japanese trade surplus some of it this year but he said the reduction would be due principally to the exchange rate shifts since the plaza agreement and these shifts would take a long time to work their way through

united states and canada could spur the economies of both sides substantially according to a study released by the institute for international economics the study by paul wonnacott said a successful conclusion to the free trade talks now under way could raise canada s gross national product by more than five pct and expand u s export s by about seven pct he said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of government subsidies end curbs on trade in services and investments and pave the way for new global talks under the general agreement on tariffs and trade the united states and canada the world s two biggest trading partners with cross border shipments of about billion dlrs a year opened free trade talks last june they are aiming for a pact by next october wonnacott an economics professor at the univerity of maryland said an agreement should include elimination of tariffs between the two countries phased in over a five to year period equal access to federal government procurement in the two countries replacing current buy america and buy canada provisions with a buy north america provision fewer restrictions in trade in services chiefly finance and transportation a commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor domestic producers a commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem the two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to or pct without imposing coutervailing duties the limit on subsidies is now pct he proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for resolution at an early stage wonnacott said bilateral free trade would contribute to the efficiency of the north american economies and to their competitiveness in facing overseas producers he said it would it would open u s markets to canadian goods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass production benefits to the united states would be fewer than those to canada proportionately he said because of the already large u s gross national product wonnacott said also that a u s canada pact in such areas as export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commission could set an example for the current attempt by gatt to write new and more liberal global trading regulations  koreans to buy billion dlrs in u s goods south korean foreign trade minister rah woon bae said his country s firms have agreed to buy billion dlrs worth of u s goods during his two week buying trip to the united states rah said most of the purchases represented shifts

japan pushes its chipmakers japanese microchip makers are being strong armed into compliance with a u s japan pact on semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening japan s market to foreign chips industry analysts said but doubts remain over whether the ministry of international trade and industry miti which is pressuring the firms can successfully battle market forces and whether the u s industry is geared up to take advantage of any breathing space they said u s threats to scrap the agreement signed last september have pushed miti to try harder to get recalcitrant japanese chipmakers to abide by the pact the analysts said miti has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry to get things done said bache securities japan associate vice president peter wolffe last month miti told chipmakers to cut production for the january to march period by pct to help dry up inexpensive chips that have escaped from japan to grey markets not subject to the pact s price controls the ministry also asked electronics firms to provide distributors with certificates designating them as authorised exporters in an effort to close loopholes through which grey marketeers sneak chips out of japan market analysts said u s trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in jeopardy because of continued dumping in non american markets and little sign of increased foreign sales in japan but major japanese firms appear to have agreed to the production cuts several analysts said last week nec corp said it would cut production in line with miti s request nec has been the most aggressive in resisting miti s demands said david keller analyst at james capel and co once nec cuts production it means they all have still pressures remain to keep production high japanese firms need high output to cut unit prices for u s sales that the commerce department assigns them under the pact the best way to lower cost is to produce more said salomon brothers asia ltd analyst carole ryavec preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also spur higher production next quarter merrill lynch analyst matt aizawa said grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new restrictions some industry officials said it s like tax avoidance schemes said steve donovan head of mmi japan k k as soon as you close one route another opens miti s pressure has annoyed some makers who had earlier shrugged off miti guidance it s getting to be like communism said one but analysts said output cuts could help by making it easier to increase prices as planned on april and forcing firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss they re going to have to start running their businesses like businesses bache s wolffe said miti has also been conducting a highly public campaign urging chip users to buy foreign made chips but u s industry officials said response has been mixed at best there has been some change but it s not across the board said one u s spokesman the companies have a varying degree of urgency the ultimate impact of all these efforts by miti on the troubled u s industry remains in doubt analysts added pressure to cut production of kilobit dram dynamic random access memory chips could merely speed the transition to one megabit chips where japan now leads analysts said whether u s firms are able to stage a comeback in memory chips or interested in doing so also remains unclear they said analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new u s consortium which hopes to challenge japan by developing the most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing even in the thorny area of access much depends on u s commitment as well as on japanese openness some said the sia u s semiconductor industry association doesn t even have an office here a source close to the industry said you could question just how committed they are in addition some industry analysts question the effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third country chipmakers such as those in south korea south korea s gaining market share said one analyst they re the real winners from the agreement  soviet economist sees few gains in u s

legislation rha said i hope the leaders can get together to find a solution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions but he added the leaders seem hesitant to make concessions because of

protect american industries meeting in closed session the house ways and means trade subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues in the bill whether they will force major foreign trading partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the united states the subcommittee is considering a toned down version of democratic sponsored trade legislation that aims to open foreign markets but which drops last year s effort to force president reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting specific trade penalties the legislation faces another hurdle in the full ways and means committee next week before the full house votes on it rep richard gephardt a missouri democrat who is seeking his party s presidential nomination said he may offer an amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of those countries with barriers to imports of u s goods this would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus with the united states by japan south korea taiwan west germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances my criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for getting the trade deficit down he told reporters the trade law changes are to become part of a major congressional and administration effort to turn around the record u s trade deficit of billion dlrs last year by opening up foreign markets and making u s products more competitive house speaker james wright a texas democrat said again today he expects the full house will approve the trade bill by may and that reagan will accept

include work by other committees to ease export controls on high technology to aid u s workers displaced by foreign competition to stimulate research and development to remove foreign trade barriers and to improve education and worker training the lawmakers agreed that for the first time a u s industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the country s economic development they transferred to u s trade representative clayton yeutter the powers now held by reagan to decide whether to retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and whether an injured industry deserves import relief they agreed to make it easier for a company to get temporary relief from import competition but agreed the industry should provide a plan to become competitive the administration has not announced its support but yeutter said yesterday i am cautiously optimistic that the democratic led house will come up with an acceptable bill  soviet minister says trade boost up to french soviet first deputy prime minister vsevolod murakhovsky said at the end of

said the soviet union had many tasks ahead of it and would deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting he encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws guaranteeing the interests of foreign partners in joint ventures but he said no agreements had yet been finalised under the new joint venture laws he said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a result of a one billion dollar accord signed in moscow last month with french businessman jean baptiste doumeng he said doumeng s interagra company was preparing proposals for further examination by the soviet union doumeng last month said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of goods murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent and designed primarily to renew and increase the soviet union s food production capacity  britain calls on japan to increase imports britain today called on japan to increase foreign imports or risk the rise of protectionism and the harm it would bring to it and other trading nations british trade and industry secretary paul channon said japan must heed a report issued by a japanese government advisory body in december calling for faster domestic demand to help cut its trade surplus and restructure its economy i recognise that the strong yen has brought problems to japan s domestic economy he told a group of japanese businessmen in london but these short term difficulties should not be allowed to deflect japan from the fundamental reforms necessary he said it is not just a domestic issue for japan if import propensity does not expand very soon there is a real risk from protectionist lobbies particularly in the u s with whom japan has so massive a surplus he said they may well succeed in securing action by governments which would be highly injurious to trading nations like japan and the u k channon said there had been substantial growth in the volume of trade between japan and britain amounting to billion sterling billion dlrs last year but he added regrettably too much of it was in one direction with the japanese selling us billion sterling billion dlrs more than we sold them  taiwan further relaxes foreign goods import curbs taiwan said it

fail to set pact on free trade prime minister brian mulroney said he held frank discussions with the canadian province premiers on the pace of free trade talks with the united states but the longstanding issue of provincial ratification remains to be settled speaking to reporters after nearly five hours of meetings with the premiers mulroney said further discussions would be held in june and september to discuss the role of the provinces in approving any new trade deal but he maintained progress was being made in the sweeping talks with the unites states that got under nearly two years ago it appears reasonable progress is being made in the talks mulroney said alberta premier don getty agreed things are running pretty quickly now the talks launched by mulroney s progressive conservative government after concerns about protectionist sentiment in the u s are aimed reducing the remaining barriers between the world s largest trading partnership but the provinces are expected to play a major role in any new trading arrangement and some of the provincial leaders complained of a lack of progress on reaching a ratification formula it s my view that we should be thinking about these things right now along with the questions of the substance of the agreement commented ontario premier david peterson who has been highly critical of the talks in the past but newfoundland premier brian peckford said an agreement was more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be no need for a hard and fast formula peckford said it appears canada is prepared to make concessions to the united states on financial services in order to make inroads on other bargaining areas such as agriculture canadian published reports quoting government sources say the two countries are close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border tariffs and many non tariff barriers over the next to years a rough draft of the accord is expected to be presented to the premiers at

trade subcommittee approves bill to toughen u s trade laws no clear evidence trade gap reversed volcker federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said current data does not give a clear sign that

offered few new details of the talks said that while the negotiations were risky and difficult a profile of a major trade deal is now emerging in a minute address mulroney made an often passionate defense of the initiative that he said would give poorer areas of the country a major economic boost because of our trading patterns over a period of decades we are in the process of building two canadas one that is rich and promising one that is under developed and under employed said mulroney what we want is to make sure newfoundlanders and british columbians and albertans and others that

michael jopling british minister of agriculture fisheries and food warned it would not be sensible to provoke another dispute between europe and the united states jopling said in remarks prepared for an evening speech but some things are clear and they apply on both sides of the atlantic we cannot continue to pile up stocks while world demand shrinks he said governments must not operate farm policies as if they were purely domestic affairs with no impact on others they also have to recognize that they cannot in the long run develop a healthy and stable farm sector on the basis of protectionism and excessive subisdies and above all europe and the united states have too many common interests to make it worthwhile to engage in trade wars and competitive export subsidies which end by benefitting no one he added it is crucial that the united states and the european community remain friends jopling who is a member of the ec agriculture committee was in indiana to visit several farms prior to talks with u s officials in washington later this week jopling also criticized a recent proposal still under consideration by the ec for a tax on vegetable and fish oils he said his

year plan to cut its trade deficit with japan breaks gatt rules trade ministry officials here said they said japan submitted a report earlier this month alleging south korea s plan to import less from

billion dlrs by south korea s trade deficit with japan was a record billion dlrs in and rose to mln dlrs in the first two months of from mln in the same period the plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to import japanese goods and to exporters to sell more to japan the officials said they believed the japanese action one step short of filing a suit was designed to bring south korea to

japan says u s japan microchip pact working japanese officials sought to convince the u s that a u s japan pact on microchip trade is working ahead of an april deadline set by the u s for them to prove their case we are implementing the agreement in good faith and the situation does not run counter to the pact osamu watanabe director of the ministry of international trade and industry s miti americas and oceanic division told foreign reporters the effects of the measures we have taken and are taking are emerging in the market place he said u s trade officials have repeatedly accused japanese microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at below cost in markets outside japan and the united states the agreement signed last september aimed at halting predatory japanese pricing policies and increasing u s semiconductor firms access to the japanese market the comments by miti officials followed a call by prime minsiter yasuhiro nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on the u s side about the pact watanabe said yukio honda director of miti s industrial electronics division denied that japanese chipmakers were selling at below cost in third countries miti s call to japanese chip makers last month to cut production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in the non regulated grey market honda said the grey market exports from japan are shrinking now but in contrast u s and south korean companies are expanding market share because of their cheaper prices honda said miti plans to take further steps to reduce the excess supply of inexpensive chips which developed in japan after the pact was formed because of a slump in japanese semiconductor exports to the united states he added the ministry will soon release its supply demand guidelines for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are likely to be lower than that for the first quarter he said despite businessmen s ingenuity in finding ways around any artificial controls regulation of supply and demand should bring positive results watanabe said i am optimistic he added  ec warns u s

the general agreement on tariffs and trade that south korea s five year import diversification plan violated the spirit of the world trade governing body a foreign ministry spokesman said the

on japan as a source of imported goods and to increase imports from the u s and europe japan s move came after several unsuccessful bilateral negotiations on the plan the spokesman said the notification does not represent anything resembling a formal complaint nor is it intended to pressure south korea it is a routine procedure followed by all other gatt member states  dutch official warns of more trade conflicts already strained relations between the u s and the european community ec are likely to get worse before they get better director general of the dutch economics ministry s foreign affairs division frans engering said speaking at an american chamber of commerce lunch in the hague engering noted the developing history of crises over steel citrus and pasta and warned of more to come i consider the strident tone of us declarations on airbus ill advised and the ec fats and oils tax proposal a dangerous provocation he said i feel that we shall probably have to deal with quite a few more crises in the foreseeable future not only is the us congress clearly very determined to get the american balance of payments into better shape but the risks of brinkmanship are all the greater because the ec has its own constraints in meeting outside pressure engering noted if we ask ourselves whether it is perhaps inevitable that we keep pushing each other to the brink of actual trade war then i think the answer is probably yes he said in order to reduce these tensions decision making in the ec must become less self centred and the us administration will have to exercise the authority to convince congress and pressure groups of the need for accommodation he added  u s treasury announces oecd tied aid pact u s treasury secretary james baker said an agreement has been reached by members of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd to control the unfair trade practice of using tied aid to promote trade he said in a statement the agreement culminates the reagan administration s effot to negotiate a virtual end to export credit subsidies the practice of other governments using tied aid or mixed credits to promote exports has cost the united states lost jobs and lost exports the treasury said the agreement to be implemented in two stages by july would ban tied aid credit among industrialized countries and place limits on permitted aid by developing countries it would also reduce export credits that do not involve aid and reduce credit subsidies permitted for relatively poor countries the treasury said baker said the agreement imposes particular sacrifices on japan and praised japan s willingness to accept the pact as a demonstration of the japanese government s willingness to take concrete steps to resolve important trade issues
