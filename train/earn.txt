from mln dlrs a year ago taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank s international operations remains weak reflecting resource

quarter from mln dlrs a year ago while earnings from international operations plunged to mln dlrs from mln dlrs last year royal bank said first quarter international net interest income declined from last year reflecting reduced revenues from international investment banking as well as a significant loss on disposal of its affiliate in trinidad and tobago other income rose to mln dlrs from mln dlrs last year the rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail deposit service fees and higher foreign exchange revenue but lower securities commissions from international investment bank

order one of general electric co s biggest businesses aircraft engines will ride a wave of increasing profits into because of a new contract worth mln dlrs wall street analysts said previously it was expected the business would peak and decline at some point in the next five years the improved outlook results from amr corp s amr decision to order new planes powered by cf c ge engines creative financial footwork helped ge get the order said nicholas heymann analyst at drexel burnham lambert inc amr declined to go into detail on financing arrangements for its order of boeing co ba and airbus industrie twinjet long distance aircraft but amr said it was using rent a plane leases that allow it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt structure amr also has the right to decline delivery of the planes or return them on short notice the arrangement protects amr in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe downturn in the economy from ge s point of view the package looks like a good deal for several reasons heymann said ge will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of delivery heymann noted and if for some reason amr decides not to take the planes ge s financial arm general electric financial services inc would have little trouble rounding up another airline that wanted the fuel efficient planes on the whole the deal appears to pose little risk for ge heymann said ge s stock declined to on shares by midafternoon h p smith analyst at smith barney harris upham and co said for a billion dlr revenue company no one order will have much of an effect on the stock russell leavitt analyst at salomon brothers inc said the order will help to maintain a good level of production and profitability in the aircraft engine business for ge heymann sees operating profits from ge s jet engine business rising from mln dlrs last year to billion dlrs by revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last year with well over half of the business in the military sector according to analysts estimates the rosy outlook for ge s jet engine business coincides with an upbeat performance in other segments heymann expects ge to earn dlrs per share in the first quarter of saying many will be suprised by the results he believes ge has shown through its acquisition of rca corp that it has a unique ability to buy a major business and reshape it pruning some parts and recombining parts with other elements of its business areas smith sees ge earning dlrs per share in the current quarter he credits good results at rca in turn aided by the nbc

technological innovation i worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of contracting approaches too early in the development stages of important military contracts beall said adding long term

a share buyback program announced yesterday but analysts said gm s future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share gm shares rose to in active trading analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker s long term prospects i m very positive on gm said jack kirnan of kidder peabody and co they re clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value however some analysts worry about how gm will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share after the market had closed yesterday gm said it would buy back pct of its common stock by the end of the announcement sent investors today scrambling for gm shares with more than mln shares changing hands by mid day the buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning and at least one increased his earnings estimates for gm based on a good performance expected from new car models but david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc said the repurchase program is not a positive the buyback doesn t really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet he said since gm will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases the stock should settle back down to around he added healy projects gm will earn five dlrs a share in and dlrs in compared to earnings of dlrs healy s numbers are near the low end of wall street estimates which range from five dlrs to dlrs in and from four dlrs to dlrs in like other analysts healy sees gm s share of the domestic car and truck market falling in on balance gm cars are not selling as well as their competitors he said in late february gm car sales fell pct from the year ago period while competitors ford motor co f and chrysler corp c both posted increases but gm said february sales showed improvement over january adding that it expects improvement in coming months overall gm s share of u s car and truck sales should fall to around or pct in from pct at the end of analysts said the numbers include imports kidder peabody s kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter which will help gm finance the buyback gm stock has been a real laggard and now it s rolling up its sleeves and getting serious i think there s a major earnings surprise in the winds he said kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today in part in reaction to the announced buyback and sees gm earning dlrs this year and dlrs in the company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to ford and chrysler he said another positive for the stock is gm s dividend currently five dlrs a share annually which gives it a higher yield than its competitors kirnan said and gm will raise the cash dividend to cts a share next year he predicted but analyst michael lucky of shearson lehman brothers inc said u s car sales will weaken and gm s new products if successful will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share i believe their new cars will be successful but that will only curtail losses in market share which will fall to around pct by lucky said philip fricke of goldman sachs and co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears while he is recommending gm stock he said results will not improve until i m not looking for improvement this year this is a transition year for gm he said fricke who estimates earnings at dlrs and at dlrs said cost cutting and new car models will not affect results but the key thing isn t so much what they earn this year it s the momentum beyond this year that s important goldome fsb year net net mln vs mln note company is mutual savings bank bear

that the company faced some regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its pacific bell operating company in rates hearings before the california public utility commission guinn said the

hike requested for guinn said the commission found mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations and assumptions while mln dlrs might represented unneeded modernization costs guinn also said that the company is still studying whether to join an international consortium that plans to lay a transpacific telephone cable between the u s and japan we have not agreed to anything guinn said but added he would soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the company would make a decision soon on participating asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the u s department of justice which would allow the bell operating companies to offer limited long distance services guinn said the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion long distance services is a very competitive business it s a commodity business and becoming more so he said i m not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that business however guinn generally applauded the u s recommendations saying they would give more latitude for the bell operating companies to expand into non regulated businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic alliances with other companies he added that while the company welcomes the expansion into new areas it is not currently involved in any acqusition talks we do not have anything actively under consideration he said

by positive trends in the group s other divisions the spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic group would show a net profit in adding this would depend partly on the level of provisions preussag cut its dividend to eight marks from nine marks on results after parent company net profit dropped to mln marks from mln the year before the preussag world group made a net loss of mln marks in after a net profit of mln the year before domestic group net profit fell to mln from mln the statement said its results in were affected by unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector the reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an additional factor behind the drop in

decline in profits for as increasing provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non performing loans bankers in the saudi capital said the need to build reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a little this year but the kingdom s still sluggish economy and legal problems hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will remain vulnerable one senior bank credit officer said the work is largely done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money the sudden decline of saudi arabia s corporate sector in culminating in a number of debt reschedulings has taken a heavy toll of bank profits with first results now appearing for showing a fourth successive year of broad decline the cumulative net earnings of the kingdom s banks had sunk to mln riyals from billion in before world oil prices tumbled of the kingdom s nine joint venture banks which operate on the gregorian calendar year four have already reported and revealed a further profits decline or net loss for at the expense of increased provisions the newest and smallest of the joint ventures united saudi commercial bank uscb reported a net loss of mln riyals marginally less than s shortfall of mln profits before provisions were sharply higher in part reflecting an pct staff cut last year but the bank nearly trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to mln riyals from mln in other results released so far show saudi american bank samba reporting a pct fall in net profit to mln riyals while al bank al saudi al fransi known as saudi french slid pct to mln riyals both saudi american owned pct by citicorp s cci n citibank na and saudi french pct owned by banque indosuez increased provisions sharply arab national bank s net profit fell pct to mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to mln riyals bankers said there are first signs that the number of non performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the saudi economy bottoms out few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic activity but one banker said the top pct of the saudi banks are now at or close to international levels on provisions from to the kingdom s largest bank national commercial bank ncb stashed away billion riyals in provisions or pct of its total loans and advances to the private sector bankers calculated between and riyad bank ncb s rival as the second biggest of the two all saudi shareholding banks had covered pct of its loans and advances both banks operate on an islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine although the saudi arabian monetary agency sama has been tightening supervision there is still no standardised rule for declaring loans as non performing bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures difficult because some banks still book non accruing interest as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in force in major world financial centres bankers generally said ncb riyad bank and the joint ventures samba saudi french and arab national bank rank as the strongest earners other banks such as saudi british bank pct owned by the british bank of the middle east are disadvantaged by a relatively low deposit base saudi british slashed profit pct to just mln riyals and accounts due soon are expected to show another low figure but the bank has traditionally been one of the most conservative in making provisions bankers said sama has proved it is not prepared to see a saudi bank go under and not only supported saudi cairo bank after its troubled accounts came to light but also made available cheap deposits to saudi investment bank and uscb the banks can on lend these to generate profit but generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are unwilling to risk incurring fresh non performing loans and while banks in more liberal financial markets can attempt to diversify away from traditional lending conservatism in saudi banking has made it difficult to generate fee income from new investment banking products one banker said operating earnings in the kingdom are not good reflecting the caution in new lending the amount of advances is showing a declining trend while the days when banks had ample funds in interest free current accounts to invest are disappearing as saudi customers seek a better return on their money in the ratio of interest bearing accounts to current accounts was to pct today only about pct of customer funds are held on current account japanese corporate earnings recovery predicted japanese corporate earnings will rise pct in fiscal for the first year on year increase in three years partly because of the yen s stable exchange rate the nomura

installing new digital telephone systems in britain for three to five years he said mercury communications ltd a cable and wireless plc cawl l subsidiary was becoming a significant competitor odgers said mercury was seeking to make inroads into some of british telecom s most profitable areas one company official privately estimated that british telecom still had a pct share of the u k telecommunications market but feared that this could slip to or pct the recent two and a half week engineering strike which lead to some disruption in service could well have encouraged clients to consider using the mercury system odgers said however he forecast that the last quarter s results overall should not be adversely affected by the walkout he calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls should be limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities but on balance odgers said that group s financial strength economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growth industry will help produce annual profit increases for the forseeable future british telecom will also seek to expand into manufacturing he

rather than the actual two pct had it not been for november s warehouse fire a senior company official said the official who declined to be identified told reuters sandoz had made a substantial

last year the official said the company is expected to give fuller details of its results at a news conference on april sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover any liability arising from the accident the official said the addition to reserves was to cover the one pct of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution from the fire sandoz has not given any figure for claims which have been flowing in from switzerland and other countries bordering the rhine since the accident however the official said the final figure

hit by the falling dollar the official said sales in local currency terms were up by pct with market share increases in the united states and japan but this was more than offset by a pct negative

liquidity was strong bank debt had been cut by about one third to billion francs against the end level of billion cash flow improved substantially to mln francs from mln and represented pct of

crsz z to convert mln francs of credits into a subordinated loan the main sources of losses in were book losses and not cash losses haerri said existing credit lines were used only to a small extent and the parent company had been granted a new credit line of mln francs from a consortium of swiss banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining bauxite rights as an asset and so had restated the accounts that left the account with a mln franc loss instead of mln with a mln profit instead of mln with a mln loss instead of mln and with a mln loss instead of mln the new accounts show with shareholders equity of billion francs instead of billion and similar alternations were made for previous years after losses shareholder s

pursuing a bold global expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its yearly earnings to pct president michael cornelissen said first marathon securities ltd financial services analyst michael walsh said royal trust s international growth target is attainable but it will be a tremendous achievement because they re going to have to build an international earnings base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic trust companies walsh said global operations which made up pct of royal trust s mln dlr net profit will post pct profit growth this year against an expected pct jump in total company profit cornelissen told reuters in an interview he said the foreign share of total profit would rise to pct in and to pct by royal trust canada s second largest trust company with assets of about billion canadian dlrs has operated internationally since when it opened a london bank its aggressive global strategy began in the s when other canadian trusts the equivalent of u s savings and loans were focusing on domestic retail banking the company s overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened domestic competition and impressive growth at its london bank operations which attained full british banking powers in cornelissen said last year royal trust moved into continental europe and asia with its mln canadian dlr acquisition of dow chemical co dow s dow financial services corp which included asset management merchant and private banking companies it was a heaven sent opportunity cornelissen said of the dow financial acquisition we achieved in one year what would otherwise have taken five to years to set up cornelissen stressed that royal trust would shun direct competition with major global financial institutions in activities such as international lending and stock brokerage in order to exploit profitable niches overseas in traditional trust activities such as asset management private banking and advisory services he said that royal trust hoped to complete negotiations before the end of this month to sell its london based savory milln brokerage acquired in the dow financial deal the international market is so big and we have such a miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really limited only by our energy and our desire to find more business he said adding that in trust type services we don t think the international markets are well served aiding royal trust s foreign growth are greater foreign investment interest in north america and increased canadian investment abroad cornelissen said central to royal trust s strategy is asia boasting rapid economic growth and huge pools of japanese capital said cornelissen whose company administers assets of billion dlrs more than any other canadian trust citing statistics indicating that by the year asia will contain two thirds of the world s population and pct of global productive capacity cornelissen said we knew we had to be there royal trust s international locations include offices in tokyo hong kong and singapore the company also recently listed its shares on the tokyo stock exchange the royal trust president said the company was stressing growth within its overseas units adding he did not foresee any acquisitions in the immediate future although we have our eyes wide open for the right opportunities asked about royal trust s plans for the u s which the company abandoned with the sale of its florida bank units cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well covered by hundreds of small regional banks that doesn t mean to say we shouldn t be in the u s said cornelissen that is probably one area that we will probably do something with in the next five years he said the company would continue to emphasize its home canadian market which cornelissen and financial services analysts agreed would remain vital to royal trust proposed government regulations to allow canadian banks trusts insurance and securities dealers full participation in one another s actitivies will mean more domestic competition for royal trust but not drastically more cornelissen said salomon raises caterpillar cat opinion salomon brothers inc said it raised its opinion on caterpillar inc s stock to an aggressive buy from a hold because of a brighter earnings outlook for salomon analyst david sutliff said in a statement he sees earnings of dlrs a share up from an earlier forecast of three dlrs for the year the outlook for remains at dlrs to three dlrs caterpillar s stock was down points at although earnings will be poor for the next two quarters we believe that profits could begin to improve in the second half perhaps significantly and should surge sharply through and he said sutliff said improved results should come from four factors higher prices improved market share reduced costs and improved demand the higher prices will stick because its japanese competitor komatsu has had to raise prices because of the increased value of the yen he

probably fell to pct from pct cathay added new planes and was forced to fly some routes last year because of the threat of competition from dragon air said tsang this affected its load factor fear of

illinois corp s cil chairman john swearingen said he sees negotiations to reschedule brazil s debt payments taking at least three to six months brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of

arrangement to be worked out to reschedule brazil s debt swearingen told reporters at a press briefing i think brazil will pay its debts in the long run just how long the run is is anybody s guess swearingen said earlier the bank holding company said brazil s moritorium may force it to increase non performing loans by mln dlrs and reduce pretax and net income by mln dlrs in the first quarter and mln dlrs for the full year the bank will decide march whether to characterize these loans as non performing william ogden chairman of the continental illinois national bank and trust co of chicago continental s largest subsidiary said in response to an inquiry ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use swearingen

fdic during it can transfer bad loans under the terms of the restructuring agreement with the government the bank will transfer the remaining mln dlrs that it is entitled to transfer to fdic by

of overall weak loan demand in the u s concerning banking acquisitions swearingen said the bank would like to buy additional suburban chicago banks in it bought three small suburban banks swearingen said he is concerned that continental will be taken over because no bank in the midwest region is large enough to buy it and new york money center banks are prohibited by law from buying illinois banks he said however that the fdic still has control over who will eventually own the firm because it still holds the equivalent of mln common shares out of a total mln the fdic sold mln shares to the public last year and has said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible the agency received the shares as part of its billion dlrs bailout of the bank swearingen who came out of retirement in to head the struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry executive said he will retire when the three year period he agreed to be continental chairman ends in august he

i don t remember a time when there was such a clear distinction by geographic area fdic chairman william seidman told reporters he said that while the figures were not good they showed the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but with regional differences in economic performance some banks have failed so far this year twice as many as failed by this time a year ago but seidman said he doubted the pace would continue on a positive note banks increased capital to a record billion dlrs last year and there has been a slowing in the number of new problem banks in all regions

or more reporting fourth quarter losses totaled the fdic said seidman said it was too early to say what effect brazil s moratorium on debt interest payments would have on u s banks he said bank

policy it would cut its payout to francs per share from president robert staubli told a news conference that the first two months of this year gave hope that profit would at least equal last year s

mln francs the previous year he said the net profit figure was reached after receipt of some mln francs from plane sales compared with a mere mln francs in finance head martin juenger said he expected

depreciation gross profits for the previous year had been mln francs with mln subtracted for depreciation including mln francs supplementary depreciation staubli said the result well below predictions made this time last year suffered considerably due to exchange rate fluctuations in particular the strength of the swiss franc while the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in the dollar

business machines corp hit by a two year earnings slump should begin a come back by the end of and post strong growth in analyst rick martin of sanford c bernstein co inc said there will be increasing momentum in earnings albeit not until later this year martin said at a technology conference sponsored by the investment firm martin said the coming rebound reflects new product introductions in the mid range area rather than any drastic improvement in economic growth or u s capital spending ibm whose stock hit a week low of dlrs in mid january has come back lately ibm was trading up at dlrs analysts computer industry executives and the company itself have highlighted the external economic factors hampering ibm s growth but martin said the product cycle was key to understanding the rise and fall of ibm and other computer companies and pointed to digital equipment corp dec to support his view by replacing the product line earnings have soared he said of dec s line of vax computers in contrast to dec ibm faultered with an incompatible mid range product line a new computer code named fort knox was supposed to tie together a number of ibm s mid range systems but the product never got off the ground he said instead aspects of the computer were integrated into the ibm machine introduced last year and other aspects should be unwrapped by martin said the major story will be a rebound in its mid range business he said sales of ibm s mid range computers fell about pct in but the new products will lead to pct growth in mid range computers this year and pct growth in high end computers primarily the sierra line are coming to the end of their product life cycle although growing pct in the midst of ibm s sharply lower year growth will drop to pct in and pct in he said by overall revenue growth should rise to about pct against pct growth in and pct in martin said last year ibm earned billion dlrs on revenues of billion dlrs investors asked what this all meant to dec whose earnings and stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product introductions in the mid range area in response martin said he did not view ibm as a threat to dec nor dec as a threat to ibm

increased its pretax profits in despite a fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales the lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and other currencies against the mark other factors were

that the group would report a third quarter net in the region of mln to mln dlrs against mln a year earlier and mln in the second quarter bhp s earnings in the first half ended november amounted to mln dlrs sharply down from mln a year earlier the analysts predicted that bhp will report an upturn in petroleum earnings compared with the first quarter reflecting some improvement in crude oil prices from the bass strait fields but these gains would be offset by lower mineral and steel earnings they said the mineral group has been hit by lower coal prices and shipments to japan while the steel division has been affected by industrial and production problems the analysts noted that the third quarter is normally bhp s lowest earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around mln dlrs one key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be a tax break of some mln dlrs for the investment allowance on capital expenditure

marks kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to billion marks in the first five months of about pct above the same year ago period the rise was mainly due to payment in january for a west german nuclear power station which led to a jump in domestic sales of pct in the first five months turnover abroad showed a three pct increase kaske said without giving figures in the same period incoming orders rose five pct to billion marks against the same period for the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between one and two billion marks to around or billion apart from payments for the nuclear power station the communications and telecommunications sectors in particular should contribute to growth this year kaske said but it was not possible to make a profit forecast for because of uncertainty about the direction of the dollar kaske said siemens already reported that first quarter group net profit fell marginally to mln marks from mln in the same period in the previous year turnover in the first five months rose particularly strongly in the installations and automotive technology communications and telecommunications sectors but components and energy and automation showed a sharp decline kaske said domestic orders rose to billion marks in the first five months of this year or nine pct above their level in the same period boosted in particular by orders for the fully owned kraftwerk union ag subsidiary foreign orders grew one pct to billion marks an increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad was balanced by the decline in the dollar while the installations and automotive technology sector showed a sharp rise in orders energy and automation and communications orders were below the level achieved in the same period of telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same level kaske said investments were expected to remain around six billion marks in after a pct increase the previous year research and development

provisional pct fall in total group sales to billion marks from billion the previous year third party turnover declined to billion from billion in while orders slipped to billion marks from billion it said in a preliminary statement despite these figures which reflected the dollar s weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price falls it said was a satisfactory year the reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and plant sector which accounted for pct of total sales krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had underpinned machinery and component activities an orders decline in the steel and in particular the trading and services sectors affected the group s total order figures however all business sectors contributed to the positive results achieved in krupp added without giving details domestic orders decreased by five pct to billion marks from the previous year and foreign orders fell pct to billion it said foreign business accounted for pct of orders against pct in orders received by the machinery and plant sector member companies which comprise the core area of the group rose by four mln marks last year to billion krupp said the group s orders in hand amounted to billion marks at end december from billion at the start of the year orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by three pct to billion marks from it said the steel market weakened increasingly over the year mainly because of exchange rate movements the deterioration in foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer industries the difficult market for sections and flats of quality steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct krupp said but special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless cold rolled flats grew by five pct in tonnage terms lucas sees continued growth in second half lucas industries plc lucs l said its underlying performance would continue to improve in the second half but profits would be restrained by low activity in u k commercial vehicle and tractor markets as well as in north american electronics the company earlier reported a two mln

major u s banks take similar action after the end of their first quarter tomorrow analysts said american bankers said last week that slow progress in debt talks with brazil increased the likelihood that u s banks would soon declare their brazilian loans non performing such action would put a lot of pressure on the canadian banks to do the same levesque beaubien inc toronto based bank analyst donna pulcine told reuters they banks like to appear to be conservative said pulcine and if a major bank puts loans on a non performing basis and the canadian banks don t there is going to be a lot of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering the loans non performing and another bank is not wood gundy inc bank analyst patricia meredith said any willingness by a major brazilian bank creditor such as citicorp cci to declare its brazilian loans non performing rather than let brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling example for other creditor banks in order to make that strategy work they citicorp have to have the support of the other banks said meredith bank analyst michael walsh at first marathon securities ltd said at least one canadian bank which he declined to identify wants to put the brazilian loans on a non performing basis and is trying to encourage the others to take that position canadian banks are owed about seven billion canadian dlrs by brazil which late last month suspended interest payments on its billion u s dlr foreign bank debt banks in canada although allowed to wait up to days before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest as non performing usually move on such loans within days they could therefore delay action on the brazilian loans until late may which falls in canadian banks third quarter ending july bank of montreal brazil s largest canadian bank creditor said last week it was not currently considering declaring its billion dlrs of brazilian loans as non performing i think that is just for the benefit of the public walsh said of bank of montreal s statement some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on canadian banks from a move to declare the brazilian loans non performing they said brazil would likely resume interest payments by the banks fiscal year end on october thus allowing banks to recoup their lost interest income from what brazil has said it is quite likely the banks will get the money said meredith my outlook at this point is optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full year s earnings meredith forecast fully diluted per share earnings of dlrs for royal bank of canada compared with in dlrs for bank of montreal compared with dlrs for canadian imperial bank of commerce compared with dlrs for bank of nova scotia compared with and dlrs for toronto dominion bank against she forecast dlrs for national bank of canada against dlrs before a two for one stock split analyst pulcine said she might lower full year earnings estimates for the banks by between two cts and cts a share assuming a possible settlement reduced brazil s interest costs if the banks didn t receive anything for the rest of the fiscal year the impact could range from cts to cts a share but i don t see that as a likely scenario pulcine said walsh at first marathon suggested however that the brazilian debt situation was so complex that it could drag on beyond one full fiscal year he said he foresaw having to lower his fiscal earnings forecasts for the banks he estimated that brazil s yearly interest payments to canadian banks totaled about mln dlrs or about pct of

pct wardair international ltd is third with about nine pct analysts believe pacific western s aggressive and cost conscious chairman rhys eyton will develop the true potential of the former cp air which floundered for four decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate canadian pacific ltd they said cp air s management style had been not much different from that of air canada formed years ago because neither airline was held accountable to its owners not that long ago maybe even just six months ago these two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible neither seemed that concerned about the bottom line said bradley but with cp air being run by eyton it will be very conscious of profitability and shareholder return and air canada is on the verge of going that way he said cp air always

air canada to pay more attention to finances analysts said it recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit in excess of mln to mln dlrs for however this profit recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that all canadian airlines had a good year in analysts said tourists came to canada in record numbers last year attracted by the relatively weak canadian dollar and expo in vancouver which alone had more than mln visitors for the next few years most analysts see three six pct air traffic growth and they expect profits will come from cost cutting and careful spending peter friend of walywn stodgell cochran murray ltd said institutional buyers will be eager to add air canada to their portfolios as a blue chip investment but warned that new competition makes profit growth less certain the airline with something to lose will be air canada at one time it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody else s friend said many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline shares for at least a year analysts said air canada s immediate concern ahead of a public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes without setting off a political

dome petroleum ltd earlier reporting a billion dlr loss compared to year earlier profit of mln dlrs said the loss was mainly due to write downs totalling billion dlrs before a reduction in deferred income taxes of mln dlrs the loss also includes mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses the company said the dramatic drop in energy prices in early reverses much of the progress the company has made in the two previous years dome chairman j howard macdonald said in a statement but even a net loss of this magnitude has very little bearing on the day to day operations of dome chairman macdonald said it merely reflects the realistic carrying value of the company s assets in today s economic environment and the absolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenders on a debt restructuring plan to assure the company s continued existence he added dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan for restructuring debt of more than billion dlrs dome said it charged the mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses to current expenses because of the uncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan normally the expenses would be amortized over the remaining period of the loans to which they apply it said dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarter reduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of billion dlrs before a reduction in deferred income taxes of mln dlrs the fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a charge of mln dlrs on certain other assets taken mainly in the third quarter dome said the billion dlr fourth quarter charge resulted from a year end accounting change made under new full cost accounting guidelines by the canadian institute of chartered accountants the company said it previously determined a write down of conventional oil and gas properties was not required at september under the previous method of calculating the limitation of oil and gas values dome said the most significant accounting change under the new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in calculations instead of escalating price forecasts terms of dome s proposed debt restructuring plan preclude the company from making an accurate estimate of future financing costs which are used in the new accounting calculations it said as a result dome adopted current prices and costs and a pct discount factor in the calculations which substantially conform with accounting rules prescribed by the u s securities and exchange commission the company said dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural gas segments fell by billion dlrs to a loss of billion dlrs from prior year earnings of mln dlrs dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas operating income was due to write downs totalling billion dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of dome s offshore drilling fleet in the beaufort sea also contributed to the decline it said earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by pct to mln dlrs from mln dlrs in cash from operations dropped to mln dlrs from year ago mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to mln dlrs from mln dlrs dome said crude oil production in was maintained at prior year s levels through new drilling activity and improvements in productivity

said the accounting change was prompted by delays in the receipt of a california public utilities commission decision on the company s application for rate relief to recover the billion dlr cost of

able to raise the full operating profit slightly above the record result of because own account profits increased slightly he gave no concrete details but added that in january and february good own account trading profits meant that the drop in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the partial operating figure the bank would as a result be more profit oriented in future developing for example more into investment banking keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening expenditures on fixed assets turning to results seipp said by year end there had been a strong growth in business volume over the year business volume rose by pct to billion marks compared with seipp added group balance sheet volume rose by pct to billion it would have been around five billion marks higher still if currency relationships had remained unchanged in the parent bank the interest surplus rose nine pct in the year while the interest margin held roughly at s pct despite pressure on credit rates the surplus on commission business which had soared by a quarter in rose by pct last year thanks almost exclusively to growth in securities commissions seipp said personnel expenditure was up pct last year at more than billion marks fixed asset expenditure rose by pct to more than mln as a result the parent bank partial operating profit rose by pct to mln marks parent bank tax

f during the latter s majority stake purchase booked last year the ability of the bank to write off depreciations in credit business against profits from securities trading and earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised as in prior years to its full extent because of numerous insolvencies at home by far the largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual write downs from domestic business abroad the circle of problem debtor countries rose last year although the ratio of credit exposure to provisions improved further seipp said that because about half the group s exposure to problem nations was in dollars the bank had swapped into dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks this means that no open currency positions exist any longer on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual default he added despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the last few weeks he said the international banking community is better armed than it was against payment problems all banks had significantly strengthened their capital base most european banks had made considerable provisions against bad debts while goverments and central banks were better prepared for unforseen difficulties he described debt equity swaps as a very interesting new approach to indebted nations problems there was a lot of interest in direct investment via an equity

further the weak german bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply and trading in securities also fell but earnings from currency dealing were still satisfactory he told a news conference deutsche group partial operating profits rose to billion marks in from billion in on a balance sheet of billion marks after billion profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of the former flick group which have been estimated at some one billion marks and from record profits in trading on the bank s own account not included in partial operating profits earnings from the flick transaction were booked through a subsidiary and therefore showed up as part of the interest surplus in a section current earnings from securities and participations in the group this nearly doubled to billion marks from billion as usual the bank did not detail total operating profits but it said that total operating profits including own account trading rose pct or pct without the flick transaction in the group and pct or seven pct in the parent bank banking analysts said this put group total operating profits at some to seven billion marks and parent bank operating profits at over five billion marks christians said deutsche used the extraordinary earnings from flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of its unchanged mark dividend the bank had decided against raising the dividend itself because of the uncertain business outlook at the end of and developments so far this year showed that was correct christians said west german banks rarely raise dividends unless they are sure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequent years preferring to use bonuses for one of profits the bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue a high level of risk provision christians said disclosed group risk provisions rose to mln marks in from mln in under german law disclosed provisions do not necessarily reflect the full amount of risk provisions management board joint spokesman

asked if over two thirds of such problem country debt had been written off deutsche bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of other securities to billion marks from billion in the parent bank christians said this billion mark rise was partly due to its increased activity in international share placements with some shares such as those from fiat spa s international placement last year remaining on its

diversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from loans to debt instruments banking sources said the banks following the trend are the overseas union bank ltd united overseas bank ltd oversea chinese banking corporation and the development bank of singapore ltd the shift towards securitisation has been helped by volatile financial markets which have developed hedging facilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk management said overseas union general manager loh hoon sun loh told reuters in an interview that singapore banks see limited growth in credit risk more and more of them are switching from term lending to major growth areas such as stockbroking and fee based income he said major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being granted seats on the

and the overseas union bank ltd have become major players in the equity market in singapore loh said the banks participation in the stock market has increased business transactions and provided long term growth for the market the banks are not competition for individual stockbroking firms because of the increased business they generate he added loh said the stock exchange of singapore might expand equity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because of the increasing ability of foreign and local market participants to absorb new issues loh said oub investment management ltd a subsidiary of the overseas union bank ltd has teamed up with a u k firm to launch the union global fund the fund is for local investors seeking capital growth through a diversified international portfolio it will invest in international shares with the emphasis on u s and japanese markets he said dbs securities singapore pte ltd a subsidiary of the development bank of singapore has applied to

seven pct in overseas union s profits are expected to jump to over mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in economists said the development bank s after tax profits rose pct in mainly due to a dividend of mln

mellon has a bigger involvement in energy based lending than many other banks because of the lack of a substantial recovery in energy prices this year especially in natural gas prices it was felt prudent to increase reserves and take losses on loans in this sector this action relates both to loans to companies directly involved in energy as well as loans to real estate developers home builders

about mln dlrs in private sector mexican debt he said mellon which was ordered in december to quit brazil because of its refusal to renew some short term credit lines expects to participate in efforts to helpt brazil and other sovereign borrowers to reschedule their debts loans to basic industries were not major contributors to the increase in non performing assets or to first quarter charge offs but mellon said it remains concerned about the absence of a strong recovery in steel and related industries the increase in reserves the dividend cut and continued management cost cutting are aimed at ensuring that mellon has the financial strength to deal with current uncertainties barnes said we cannot predict when the uncertainties that presently trouble us will end but we are confident we are
